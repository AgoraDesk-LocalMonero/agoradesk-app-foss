                  Buy or sell Bitcoin anonymously, without ID verification. Cash or online. Safe, fast, easy.<br /><br /><br />Wondering how to invest in Bitcoin? On AgoraDesk, purchasing bitcoins has never been easier - instantly buy BTC from a person using your favorite online payment method: PayPal, credit/debit card or bank transfer, gift cards, Venmo or any other. If you want to buy bitcoins near you with cash, you can find someone willing to sell bitcoins locally - the trading platform supports buying and selling BTC with cash. You can even buy bitcoins using cash by mail.<br /><br />- Safe and Smooth Trading<br />Just like LocalBitcoins, we support any payment method, any currency, anywhere. We do not remove payment methods, and, unlike LocalBitcoins, we fully support face-to-face cash trades. All of our trades are protected by an arbitration bond. Thanks to the fact that we require funds to be held in arbitration bond before a trade can start, we ensure a smooth and safe experience for the buyer, which is essential for the popularity of the platform and repeat customers for the sellers.<br /><br />- No KYC/AML or ID Verification<br />AgoraDesk is committed to maintaining the simplicity and straight-forwardness that made the original LocalBitcoins so popular. We do not employ KYC/AML, nor do we ever plan on doing so.<br /><br />- Trusted by the Community<br />Our platform has operated for over four years, survived the Great Cryptocurrency Market Crash of 2018, and through its community-oriented diligent service became one of the most trusted names in the extremely skeptical cryptocurrency community.<br /><br />- Secure, Open Source, Privacy-Centric, Censorship-Resistant<br />Our app is free and open source, which ensures that many eyes are looking at the app's code to ensure that there are no security holes or privacy leaks. Open sourcing our app also allows anyone to have access to our app even if a certain app repository censors the app. Our app even works on phones that have Google completely blocked. We value your privacy so much, we don’t even require you to provide an email when registering.<br /><br />Source code: https://github.com/AgoraDesk-LocalMonero/agoradesk-app-foss<br />Issue tracker: https://github.com/AgoraDesk-LocalMonero/agoradesk-app-foss/issues<br /><br />- Stellar Support<br />Our support team is fast, responsive and always eager to please. We’ve never had a support ticket that wasn’t answered within 24 hours. We are always easily reachable through social media, we listen intently to your criticisms and we always implement good user suggestions in record time.<br /><br />You can reach our support at: https://agoradesk.com/support<br /><br />- Fair Fees<br />We do not charge exorbitant fees when you deposit or withdraw Bitcoins to/from our arbitration bond wallet. There is no deposit fee, and the withdrawal fee is very close to the fee you’d be paying on a normal transaction.<br /><br />

                  Buy or sell Bitcoin anonymously, without ID verification. Cash or online. Safe, fast, easy.<br /><br /><br />Wondering how to invest in Bitcoin? On AgoraDesk, purchasing bitcoins has never been easier - instantly buy BTC from a person using your favorite online payment method: PayPal, credit/debit card or bank transfer, gift cards, Venmo or any other. If you want to buy bitcoins near you with cash, you can find someone willing to sell bitcoins locally - the trading platform supports buying and selling BTC with cash. You can even buy bitcoins using cash by mail.<br /><br />- Safe and Smooth Trading<br />Just like LocalBitcoins, we support any payment method, any currency, anywhere. We do not remove payment methods, and, unlike LocalBitcoins, we fully support face-to-face cash trades. All of our trades are protected by an arbitration bond. Thanks to the fact that we require funds to be held in arbitration bond before a trade can start, we ensure a smooth and safe experience for the buyer, which is essential for the popularity of the platform and repeat customers for the sellers.<br /><br />- No KYC/AML or ID Verification<br />AgoraDesk is committed to maintaining the simplicity and straight-forwardness that made the original LocalBitcoins so popular. We do not employ KYC/AML, nor do we ever plan on doing so.<br /><br />- Trusted by the Community<br />Our platform has operated for over four years, survived the Great Cryptocurrency Market Crash of 2018, and through its community-oriented diligent service became one of the most trusted names in the extremely skeptical cryptocurrency community.<br /><br />- Secure, Open Source, Privacy-Centric, Censorship-Resistant<br />Our app is free and open source, which ensures that many eyes are looking at the app's code to ensure that there are no security holes or privacy leaks. Open sourcing our app also allows anyone to have access to our app even if a certain app repository censors the app. Our app even works on phones that have Google completely blocked. We value your privacy so much, we don’t even require you to provide an email when registering.<br /><br />Source code: https://github.com/AgoraDesk-LocalMonero/agoradesk-app-foss<br />Issue tracker: https://github.com/AgoraDesk-LocalMonero/agoradesk-app-foss/issues<br /><br />- Stellar Support<br />Our support team is fast, responsive and always eager to please. We’ve never had a support ticket that wasn’t answered within 24 hours. We are always easily reachable through social media, we listen intently to your criticisms and we always implement good user suggestions in record time.<br /><br />You can reach our support at: https://agoradesk.com/support<br /><br />- Fair Fees<br />We do not charge exorbitant fees when you deposit or withdraw Bitcoins to/from our arbitration bond wallet. There is no deposit fee, and the withdrawal fee is very close to the fee you’d be paying on a normal transaction.<br /><br />
