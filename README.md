## App Features üî•

1. Within one code base there are 2 apps: AgoraDesk, LocalMonero.
Each app can be built as Android and iOS native app.
Design and logic separation made with flavors (more info further in this doc).

2. Universal Links work for Android and iOS. In case app is installed on the device,
the regular links will run apps instead of browser.
In case of two apps installed on one device the AgoraDesk app prioritized (it means in case of link
localmonero/something AgoraDesk app will be opened).

3. Push notifications work on iOS & Android. In case user's device
(for example in China or with GrapheneOS) can't receive pushes, app detects it and start
polling in the background mode. [More info](Notifications.md)

4. For anonymisation reasons all notifications sent without translations and translated on client.
So, we use data messages to display them with app code (not with the FCM).


5. Made with Dart & Flutter ‚ù§Ô∏è


## Build

For build the app locally after getting code from repository use FOSS commands in `Makefile`.

For example, to build FOSS apk LocalMonero app
`flutter build apk --verbose --flavor localmonero --dart-define=app.flavor=localmonero --dart-define=app.includeFcm=false`

Apps use mapbox key. You need to create a key

https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/get-started-tokens-api/

and after that create a file `lib/keys/keys.dart` and add there your key
`const keysMapToken = 'YOUR_MAPBOX_KEY';`

## Translation

The source of truth for the translation files is .json language files for web-version.
https://github.com/AgoraDesk-LocalMonero/translation

In the flutter we use .arb files. For conversion to both directions use dart util

## Known issues

### Push notifications

Backend sends data messages. We get them in the app, translate and display.
So, when the app is terminated, we should run the app, handle the message and display it.

#### iOS issues

1. Crashes when receiving notification. Connected with awesome notifications settings.

## Contribution

1. Commits naming https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

Types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.

Mark commit number with #, for example `fix: #89`.

Also we can use following:

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- test: Adding missing tests
- chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
