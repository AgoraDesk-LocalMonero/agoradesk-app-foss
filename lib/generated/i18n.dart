/// ## Update pubspec.yaml
///
/// Please make sure to update your pubspec.yaml to include the following
/// packages:
///
/// ```yaml
/// dependencies:
///   # Internationalization support.
///   flutter_localizations:
///     sdk: flutter
///   intl: any # Use the pinned version from flutter_localizations
///
///   # Rest of dependencies
/// ```

/// locales, in an Info.plist file that is built into the application bundle.
/// To configure the locales supported by your app, you’ll need to edit this
/// file.
///
/// First, open your project’s ios/Runner.xcworkspace Xcode workspace file.
/// Then, in the Project Navigator, open the Info.plist file under the Runner
/// project’s Runner folder.
///
/// Next, select the Information Property List item, select Add Item from the
/// Editor menu, then select Localizations from the pop-up menu.
///
/// Select and expand the newly-created Localizations item then, for each
/// locale your application supports, add a new item and select the locale
/// you wish to add from the pop-up menu in the Value field. This list should
/// be consistent with the languages listed in the I18n.supportedLocales

During this time you need to complete your payment and press the I have paid button. The seller is notified that you\'ve made the payment and the Monero will be held in the bond until the seller finalizes the trade for you when seeing the payment in his/her account. If you paid for the purchase, but did not mark the payment complete before the payment time window expired, please contact the seller through the trade. You can contact the seller and your other existing trade contacts from the {dashboard} in your {appName} User Profile. Send a message to the seller and kindly explain the situation and why you couldn\'t complete payment within the time window. If the seller does not respond to this request please contact {appName} support using the {supportRequestForm} and mention your trade ID.'**

  /// **'<p>In the pursuit of decentralization and a truly permissionless system, few things are as coveted in the cryptocurrency space as decentralized exchanges and atomic swaps. Since its inception, Monero has struggled to implement atomic swaps, as the privacy features create unique problems when trying to design a protocol.</p>\n\n<p>But first, let\'s back up. What are atomic swaps? An atomic swap is a protocol by which two different cryptocurrencies, on different blockchains, can be exchanged in a trustless manner with no intermediary. This means if someone wanted to exchange cryptocurrency A for cryptocurrency B, they would be able to do it without an exchange, centralized or decentralized. As one might imagine, this takes considerable research, and the full technical details that make it possible get quite complicated. Once again, LocalMonero is here to help and give a simple explanation for the common person.</p>\n\n<p>To start, let\'s consider the simplest form of atomic swap, as implemented by Bitcoin. If someone wants to exchange Bitcoin for another coin that uses the same hash time lock contract technology, they can do so in the following way. Alice has Bitcoin (BTC), but wants Litecoin (LTC), and Bob has LTC, but wants BTC. They decide to do an atomic swap so each gets the coin that they want. Alice sends her BTC to a special address, utilizing scripts that lock the funds away so even she can\'t access it. You can think of it like Alice puts her BTC in a lockbox. When the lockbox is made, she gets a key, and sends a hash of this key to Bob. Now Bob does not have the key itself, only the hash, so he can\'t yet access the funds.</p>\n\n<p>Bob uses this hash as a seed from which he generates his own lockbox, and sends his LTC there, where it is also locked. Since the hash of Alice\'s key was used as the seed by which Bob\'s lockbox was made, she can use her key to claim the LTC in Bob\'s lockbox. Her key fits! But, using math voodoo magic, when she uses her key to open the LTC lock, she reveals the key to Bob, who can then use it to claim the BTC that she put in her lockbox. In this way, with no intermediary, Alice and Bob have successfully exchanged their assets.</p>\n\n<p>But there\'s a slight problem. What if Alice sends to her lockbox, and Bob decides he doesn\'t want to trade anymore. Now, since Alice can\'t access her BTC that she locked away, and Bob won\'t complete his part of the transaction, Alice just loses her money forever. Well, luckily, Bitcoin has a little technology called refund transactions, and so after a period of time, if the BTC is not claimed by Bob, the scripts have a fail-safe built in, where the BTC will automatically go back to Alice. This was the primary speedbump for Monero\'s atomic swaps implementation. Because of Monero\'s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/ring-signatures\" class=\"next-link\">ring signatures privacy technology</a>, the sender of a transaction is always uncertain. How can the protocol do a refund transaction if even it doesn\'t know where the transaction came from?</p>\n\n<p>In 2017, a small group of researchers outlined a different method by which atomic swaps would work in Monero. After several years of refinement, the researchers finalized a process by which Monero would be able to do atomic swaps with Bitcoin, even without refund transactions.</p>\n\n<p>As with many things of this level of technical complexity, our explanation will overly simplify some things in order to convey the idea, but it will still give a solid idea of the mechanisms by which this process would work.</p>\n\n<p>Both Alice (who has XMR and wants BTC) and Bob (who has BTC and wants XMR) must download and run a program that supports the atomic swap. This may be implemented into wallets, decentralized exchanges, or special, specific programs, but the software must be running the atomic swap protocol. In the first step, Alice and Bob\'s clients connect to each other and make several shared secrets and keys. In this step, a new Monero address is created, with Alice having one half of the key, and Bob having the other. No Monero is in there yet though, so there\'s nothing to spend. One last thing to note about this address, is that they both have the view key to this wallet, so they can both peek inside to see if or when Monero arrives.</p>\n\n<p>In the second step, Bob sends his BTC to a special address, similar to the Bitcoin atomic swap protocol we\'ve already discussed. After Alice sees the BTC arrive to this address on the blockchain, she sends her Monero to the Monero address that she and Bob both have one half of a key to. Bob can verify that the Monero arrived since he also has the view key, and once he sees the Monero is safely in the wallet, he sends Alice a piece of a key that will allow her to withdraw the Bitcoin. Similar to the other protocol, the process of claiming the Bitcoin reveals her half of the Monero key to Bob. Now Bob has both halves, so he can claim the Monero, while Alice has only her half, so she can\'t try to take it before he does.</p>\n\n<p>So if you looked at all of this and are still a bit confused about how Monero was able to get around the problem of refund transactions, the answer is quite simple. Since Monero itself does not have refund transactions, the reader should notice that the Bitcoin (which does have refund transactions) is sent first, and only after it is verified as being on the blockchain is the Monero sent. This allows Monero to utilize Bitcoin\'s ability to script in refund transactions and take advantage of them, without needing to have these capabilities itself.</p>\n\n<p>The atomic swap is now complete, but from here, Bob has a couple of options for his newly claimed XMR. He can use this Monero wallet as is, or move the XMR to another wallet that he already owns. Bob will most likely move the Monero to another wallet, because Alice still has the view key and can see inside.</p>\n\n<p>The beauty of this protocol is that it\'s still quite new, and there is plenty of room for optimizations. It\'s also quite flexible in its architecture, so implementation in other wallets or decentralized exchanges should be simple and fit cleanly with their existing architecture.</p>'**

This article builds off of the concepts presented in there.</i></p>\n\n<p>Whenever individuals discuss the problems with blockchain, one of the first words to pop up will be \'scaling\'. It\'s not a secret that blockchains don\'t scale well, but most people don\'t know why.</p>\n\n<p>The truth is, scaling is actually an umbrella term that covers two different categories: Protocol support and technological support at a given point in time. In this article, we\'re going to focus our attention on one, Protocol support is basically a measure of how many transactions the protocol can handle at a given time.</p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin has a block size limit, which means once enough transactions are included in a block, any additional transactions will have to wait in line for the next block. A helpful analogy would be thinking about a train. A train pulls up to the station, and those in line file in. Once the train is full, anyone left outside will have to wait for the next one.</p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin uses fees to determine who gets into the block or not. Jumping back to the train analogy, one can imagine one potential passenger, that is about to be left behind, offers the train engineer five dollars to give him a seat. Other passengers follow suit, and eventually there is a bidding war to see who gets which seats. It\'s up to the driver to decide if he wants to honor the first-come-first-serve policy, but it\'s in his best financial interest to maximize his income by taking the highest bidders on board.</p>\n\n<p>In this analogy, miners are the train drivers. They can include whatever transactions they want in the block, but they will generally choose the ones that have the highest paid fees.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, if blocks are not very full, people have no incentive to pay high fees because there are plenty of free seats to spare.</p>\n\n<p>In the height of the 2017 cryptocurrency boom, Bitcoin was flooded with transactions, and the fees skyrocketed for those that wanted to be included in the next block, or any near-future block for that matter. Those who were unwilling to pay high fees saw their transactions pushed back for hours, days, or even drop out of the queue altogether.</p>\n\n<p>This was a harrowing insight into how Bitcoin would fare if the oft talked about ‘mass adoption’ were to occur. If Bitcoin was to be used by the masses, things would be even worse than in 2017, and Bitcoin would be inaccessible to anyone but the wealthy, simply because the throughput is small due to a fixed block size, causing the fee market to take over.</p>\n\n<p>Monero foresaw this and wanted to do something different. So the Monero developers implemented a dynamic blocksize.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, Monero also has a block size cap, but it’s a soft cap. When the line of waiting transactions gets too long, the miners can increase the size of the blocks. With our train analogy, you can imagine adding more train cars to fit the extra passengers. After the queue is empty the blocks shrink back to their original size going forward.</p>\n\n<p>If this seems like a neat idea, it seems reasonable to ask why Monero is the only cryptocurrency that has implemented this. Why not add it on Bitcoin so as to put a stop to the throughput issues?</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this is not possible. There are several reasons why, and we’ll do our best to explain.</p>\n\n<p> It\'s always in a miner\'s best interest to have large blocks. With large blocks they can fit in more transactions, and make more money off of the fees, as well as the block rewards. This has the potential to lead to spam attacks, where someone sends many small transactions, with small fees, to bloat the chain. Miner\'s would just raise the block size include them all because money is money, no matter how small. This would lead to consistently large blocks with little economic benefit. Bitcoin solves this by artificially restricting the block size, thereby generating a fee market. Spam attackers would have to outpay the other users in fees, and it is no longer cheap. But this means blocks get full leaving some transactions waiting as mentioned above.</p>\n\n<p>So how can Monero have dynamic blocksizes but avoid spam attacks? The answer is simple, but clever. A penalty on the block reward is introduced when a block is bigger than normal. If a miner wants to increase the blocksize, the reward they get from finding that block will be less than they would otherwise receive. So they will only increase the blocksize when the paid transaction fees of the users outweigh the lost portion of the block reward. For example, if the miner would lose 0.5 XMR by raising the block size, and the sum of the paid transaction fees would be 0.4 XMR, then there would be a net loss of 0.1 XMR if they were to raise the size, so they wouldn’t do it. Conversely, if the total transaction fees added up to 0.7 XMR, then there would be a net gain of 0.2 XMR, even though they lose the 0.5 XMR from the block reward penalty, so the miner will increase the size.</p>\n\n<p>These dynamic blocks, allow the network to grow organically, without aritifically restricting the blocksize to make a forced fee market, while still avoiding spam attacks. There are several more angles we can view this idea from, and more reasons why it wouldn\'t be possible to add to Bitcoin, but for now, we hope that the reader has an understanding of how Monero sidesteps several of the problems in Bitcoin and its derivatives, and how it plans to scale its throughput into the future.</p>'**

  /// **'<p>Monero is a cryptocurrency that values privacy above all else, but what most people don’t understand is that the privacy granted by using it is neither bulletproof nor absolute in certain situations. Make no mistake, Monero is about as private as it gets in the trustless realm, but there are some considerations that users must take to ensure their privacy remains strong.</p>\n\n<p>The same is true in other areas of life really. As an example, you can stay off of all social media in an effort to keep your life private, but if you are constantly with friends who snap selfies with you in them, say that they’re with you in the subtitle, and tag your location, much of your effort may be for naught. The social media conglomerate can still build a profile on you despite the fact that you personally are not on their platform.</p>\n\n<p>One of the oft-spoken of situations where people do not consider all of the implications and potentially leaked metadata is the issue of trading Bitcoin for Monero. It is commonly considered in the community that purchasing Monero with Bitcoin will be a full cleanse, and that the user retains all privacy benefits once they get into Monero, despite coming from a transparent chain.</p>\n\n<p>In a similar vein, it’s considered by some to be just as private to get Monero from non-KYC and KYC sources. The thinking goes that it is similar to getting cash at a bank. In that scenario, the bank itself knows your face and name, and knows how much you have in your account overall, and how much you withdrew in cash, but doesn’t know what you do with the cash afterwards. With Monero’s privacy guarantees, it should be just so with getting Monero from a KYC/AML source, right?</p>\n\n<p>Well, not quite.</p>\n\n<p>First, let\'s take a quick step back and define what we mean by KYC/AML. This acronym stands for Know Your Customer (KYC) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws, which require exchanges and businesses to collect identifying information on their customers. The larger the amount of money exchanged, the more information is needed. As the name implies, this is all done in the name of minmizing risk of people laundering money.</p>\n\n<p>Back to Monero. To be sure, moving your money into Monero from a KYC source is astronomically better for privacy than using a KYC source to purchase something like BTC or any other transparency coin, but there are still considerations to be made about what is revealed, and what that revealed information could mean for your privacy and safety.</p>\n\n<p>Even sticking with the cash and bank scenario, if you withdraw a large amount from the bank, since the bank knows your details (including your home address) the teller can see how much is in your account, and can potentially make nefarious plans depending on your wealth. This is rare, and since the money is in the bank rather than at your house, what they can accomplish in this scenario is relatively small. The same isn’t true for Monero, which is not secured by a third party, but rather yourself. Being your own bank isn’t always easy.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, moving from BTC to XMR, regardless of how it’s done, leaves traces on the Bitcoin blockchain. While this is indeed less damaging than going BTC to BTC because, on the other side of the exchange is Monero’s mandatory privacy, the implications of leaving a trace behind must be considered. These traces compound to even greater effect if there was KYC involved anywhere in the process.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine a scenario where dirty Bitcoins were received for a good or service, something that is only possible because of Bitcoin’s radical transparency. You don\'t know that these Bitcoins are dirty, as you don\'t have the tech to check each Bitcoin, so you, being a crypto-savvy person, aren’t comfortable with this fact, and you don’t have the money to pay a chain anlysis company to check for you. So, you decide to exchange to Monero to be safe.</p>\n\n<p>You deposit your Bitcoin onto an exchange, and swap them out for Monero, which you then pull out to your local wallet. This scenario already is a bit of a stretch, because the exchange may flag your dirty Bitcoins and lock down your account, and you may or may not get them back, but for the sake of this example we’re going to assume they let the swap happen.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, if the government becomes interested in following the trail of these Bitcoins, they will follow them to the exchange, subpoena the KYC information on the depositor, see that they were swapped to Monero (suspicious), and come knocking on your door.</p>\n\n<p>Please understand, this is not saying you should avoid swapping Bitcoin to Monero to avoid looking suspicious. You were already suspicious because you accepted dirty Bitcoin, and if you didn’t swap they’d still use blockchain analysis, and still come a’knocking. Rather, this example merely highlights that there is significant risk in using transparency coins at all, and swapping to a private, fungible coin like Monero doesn’t erase the footprints left in the transparent blockchain.</p>\n\n<p>For the individual interested in their own privacy, usage of transparent blockchains should be kept minimal, and with extreme caution. KYC should be avoided whenever possible, as this metadata can still be used to build a case and ask questions, and god forbid this KYC info (alongside trade information) gets leaked from exchanges due to incompetence. Even if you only bought and withdrew Monero from the exchange, this leaked information would still reveal how much Monero you had and where you are located. All information that we can all agree nobody would want just floating out in cyberspace.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, while using Monero does indeed negate many, many attacks and minimizes metadata leakage by default, the user themselves can do many things to ultimately destroy their own privacy. One of the least considered is the implications of using either a transparency chain as a pathway to Monero, or a KYC source to acquire it, to say nothing of using both at once.</p>\n\n<p>This article is not meant to fear-monger, but rather to encourage users to think critically about their decisions and remind them that even the best privacy can be fragile under certain circumstances. Users must be vigilant to protect their own privacy by making smart decisions about what to purchase, where, and from whom.</p>'**

  /// **'<p>As a protocol, Monero is currently in a constant state of innovation. Utilizing research in both on-chain and off-chain solutions, the Monero community looks for areas to improve to make Monero more private, more scaleable, and more accessible to all. One of the more recent innovations is the replacement of the linkable ring signature scheme, MLSAG, with a drop-in replacement CLSAG, which stands for Concise Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group.</p>\n\n<p>On the surface level, the implementation of CLSAG will decrease the most common 2 input, 2 output transactions by 25%. We’ll also see a 10% decrease in verification time.</p>\n\n<p>But what exactly is CLSAG? What does it do, and how does it differ from the old version, MLSAG? Let’s take a minute to remind ourselves of the why and how of ring signatures so we can better understand this concept. Ring signatures allow for non-interactive, witness indistinguishable inputs by use of signer-selected anonymity sets of previous outputs. In laymen’s terms, it allows a user to hide their outputs used in a transaction alongside unrelated outputs, and they can do all of this without needing anyone else to take part. All you need is a copy of the blockchain. Each of these outputs mostly appear to be equally probable of being the actual one being sent, thereby hiding metadata about the sender.</p>\n\n<p>This begets a bit of a problem, however. What if a user was to construct a ring signature with all decoy outputs? How would anyone know that the unknown sender doesn\'t have the authority to send any of them? Would this user be able to spend fake money? The answer is no. The ring signature includes a method for proving that at least one of the outputs is owned by the unknown sender, without revealing which one it is. In fact, both CLSAG and MLSAG (henceforth known as the SAGs) are the part of the ring signature that proves this. Interestingly, at the same time, it proves that the amount of the transaction, though hidden behind confidential transactions (RingCT), balances. That the SAGs prove two things, that one output is owned by someone in the ring, and that the transaction balances, is important, and actually where the size and verification savings lies. If this is getting confusing, don\'t worry, we\'ll get to a fun, and easy-to-understand analogy soon.</p>\n\n<p>The old signature scheme, MLSAG (Multilayered Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group) proves the aforementioned two things in a ring signature, but it does each separately. The use of separate computations for signing and commitment keys means slower operations. A modern computer can do these computations in a matter of milliseconds, which doesn’t seem like much, and indeed, for one transaction it’s not. But when we consider the sheer number of transactions on the Monero blockchain, and that a node syncing from scratch will have to download and verify each of them, the bytes and milliseconds start to pile up quickly.</p>\n\n<p>CLSAG combines the maths necessary to prove both into one, as well as computes both of them at once, and it does so in a safe manner. What does this mean in a safe manner? Well, to clear this up, as well as hopefully make the whole thing make more sense, let’s explore that promised fun analogy.</p>\n\n<p>Let\'s say you need to go to both the grocery store and the hardware store, to pick up two different things: food and toxic cleaning chemicals. You don’t want them to intermix, as if there is an accident, the chemicals will spill on the food, making them inedible. You decide to be super safe and drive from your house to the grocery store, buy the food, and then drive back to your house. Only after you have unloaded the food do you get back in the car, drive to the hardware store, and back to your house with the chemicals. You’ve taken two separate trips to ensure the safety of all purchases. Though it is indeed safe, it is inefficient. This represents MLSAG, where two different sets of maths are stored and two different ‘trips’ are made to compute them.</p>\n\n<p>You decide you want a faster way to do this, however. It’s too much wasted time. Sure doing it once or twice isn’t going to steal your life away, but having to do this over and over, the hours begin to add up. You start to wonder if you can make one trip instead. From your house, to the grocery store, to the hardware store, and back home. You can’t just go and throw everything in your car haphazardly. It’s not safe. Instead, you designate different spots in your car for different things, and make sure everything fits neatly in its place. In so doing, you’re able to safely make one trip to both stores, and keep things away from each other. This represents CLSAG. There is now only one set of math stored in this transaction to prove these two things, and it’s done in away that they don’t interfere with each other. A trip has to still be made, but you’ve reduced the number of them quite drastically.</p>\n\n<p>All of this sounds quite exciting. Is it possible we can find other shortcuts, or other ways to save on time and space? The answer is yes and no. According to current MRL researchers, it\'s likely not possible to further modify the SAG-type constructions for better size or speed; however other constructions like Arcturus, Omniring, RCT3, or Triptych produce much better size scaling and verification benefits using different mathematical methods. However, each of these \'next-gen\' approaches to signer-ambiguous protocols comes with its own tradeoffs in implementation details, and are undergoing active research and investigation.</p>\n\n<p>After all, Monero is always innovating.</p>'**

  /// **'<p>As all transactions are completely transparent in Bitcoin - revealing the sender, receiver, and amounts - users must take extra steps to preserve their privacy from previous senders and future recipients of their funds or risk censorship, surveillance, or theft of funds via physical violence.</p>\n<p>The best solution today for privacy on Bitcoin is a tool called <a class=\"next-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"  href=\"https://bitcoiner.guide/qna/coinjoin/\">“CoinJoin”</a>, where 2 or more users work together (usually via a centralized coordinator) to create a special transaction that makes it difficult for outside observers to connect the inputs with the outputs. Each participant communicates to jointly build the transaction without giving over custody of their funds, and receives an output at the end whose previous history is now unclear (or obfuscated) to outside observers.</p>\n<p>This breaks the history of specific UTXOs, allowing Bitcoin users to gain some modicum of forward-secrecy when transacting. However, CoinJoin (as implemented in Wasabi Wallet and Samourai Wallet, the two most-used CoinJoin tools for Bitcoin) has a few major drawbacks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As CoinJoin transactions are completely opt-in and requires active participation, any participant necessarily shows that they seek greater privacy than that of “normal” Bitcoin users, potentially singling them out and causing issues spending funds at many regulated exchanges or entities. Each user cannot deny that they participated in a CoinJoin transaction.</li>\n<li>In order to find other’s to CoinJoin with, most approaches to CoinJoin (including Wasabi Wallet) use a centralized coordinator that connects participants and helps them communicate and build a proper CoinJoin transaction. This centralized coordinator never has custody of user’s funds, but does gain extensive insight into the transactions they coordinate, can censor incoming inputs (as in the case of Wasabi Wallet), and can be pressured into collecting or sharing information about CoinJoin participants.</li>\n<li>User’s with large amounts of funds to CoinJoin can often have to wait hours (or even days!) to find enough participants to CoinJoin with, leading to large delays from the time a user receives funds to when they can spend them privately.</li>\n<li>The privacy provided by a CoinJoin transaction degrades over time as other participants spend funds or link their outputs to their identity through KYC exchanges, ID requiring merchants, etc. This means that users ideally keep their funds constantly churning in CoinJoin transactions to keep their anonymity set (“crowd to hide in”) as fresh as possible.</li>\n<li>In most approaches to CoinJoin, participants must use a fixed-size UTXO (i.e. 0.1 BTC) in order to make it harder to connect inputs and outputs of CoinJoin transactions. This leads to higher fees (more separate transactions necessary per large input), more “toxic change” (funds that are unspendable without serious risks to privacy), and can proclude smaller users from being able to mix at all if they don’t have the minimum balance required.</li>\n</ul>'**

  /// **'<p>As <a class=\"next-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"  href=\"/knowledge/ring-signatures\">we have looked deeply into what ring signatures are in the past</a>, I won’t go into great detail on the technical aspects of how they work in this blog post. Instead, we’ll look at how the approaches taken in Monero solve the issues with CoinJoin discusses above.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CoinJoin is opt-in and requires participation</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Monero’s ring signatures are a core feature of the privacy protocol, and <em>every</em> transaction on the network uses them. This means that no user’s transactions stand out for seeking greater privacy than “normal” Monero users, and all users gain plausible deniability that they spent funds in any given transaction. As a user spending funds does not coordinate or participate with the decoy inputs in a transaction, those users who own inputs that happen to be selected as decoys can honestly say they were not participating in that transaction, strengthening their privacy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Use of a centralized coordinator</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Monero’s ring signatures are entirely non-coordinated and require only the true spender of funds to create the transaction, there is no need for a centralized coordinator in Monero. This ensures that <em>no one</em> can deny you access to privacy in Monero, and there is no centralized entity that can be pressured, no easy Sybil attacks on liquidity, etc. As long as your transaction pays the proper fees, you gain uncensorable access to privacy, security, and anonymity in Monero.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CoinJoin requires liquidity</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The “liquidity” available to anyone spending Monero to use as decoys is always the total set of outputs on-chain so there is never a shortage of decoys to hide in with Monero. Someone seeking to spend Monero can do so ~20min after receiving funds, and does not need to perform any additional steps to gain strong privacy in Monero.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CoinJoin privacy degrades over time</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Monero’s outputs are never known-spent by the network, the privacy provided by ring signatures is much less susceptible to degradation over time. A user does not need to constantly churn outputs in Monero, and outside of extremely rare circumstances, loses no privacy as time goes on.</p>\n<p>If a user does want to “refresh” the decoys used with an output, however, they can merely send the funds back to themselves and be able to spend them ~20min later as usual.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CoinJoin usually requires fixed-size inputs</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As amounts are hidden in every transaction using <a class=\"next-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"  href=\"/knowledge/monero-ringct\">“Confidential Transactions”</a> (a part of “RingCT”), the decoys used in any given transaction can be of any size. There is no reason to need to be worried about amount-based heuristics in Monero, and so transactions are much simpler to build and can leverage decoys from any point in time and of any amount on the Monero blockchain.</p>'**

  /// **'<p>Each individual has their own story about traveling through the wild west that is cryptocurrency. Some find a place to speculate, some find friends, and others find technology they believe in. Despite the differences, there are commonly many similarities, even across different cryptos and communities. One of these is the disturbing likeness to cultish behavior engaged in many of the crypto communities.</p>\n\n<p>These behaviors aren’t hard to spot. An inability to take any criticism and the willful ignorance of flaws, even in the face of evidence are but a few examples. In some spaces, the cheerleading becomes so blatant that any negativity whatsoever becomes grounds for disciplinary action.</p>\n\n<p>As a cryptocurrency traveler trying to support good projects and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/monero-scams\" class=\"next-link\">not lose all of your money</a>, all cryptocurrency enthusiasts are encouraged to think critically and evaluate projects based off of their real world value, but what about approaching it from the other direction? Are projects themselves supposed to be self critical and self aware?</p>\n\n<p>We argue yes. The community itself is a reflection of the project and the leaders in it. Furthermore, a savvy community will expect more from their developers, and be able to critique proposed solutions rather than blindly trust and accept that any developers are working for the benefit of the users rather than themselves or external interests.</p>\n\n<p>Conversely, a community that only cares for price and is not able or willing to critically self-evaluate (or let others evaluate) is doomed to wallow in mediocrity.</p>\n\n<p>As a project, Monero tries to hold its developers, researchers, leaders, and community itself to the highest of standards, and minimize the risk of growing complacency and destructive apathy.</p>\n\n<p>One of the ways that Monero does this, is to hold a weekly Skepticism Sunday on the community subreddit. This is a place where people can voice their concerns about Monero, the protocol, the leadership, or any other concern they might have. It’s a place where questions and even distrust is outright encouraged, and considered necessary for the health of our ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>This comes in stark contrast to many other communities, which don’t just avoid critique, but often encourage apathy and turned-off minds from their community. This may seem harsh to say, but it’s impossible to look at the ecosystem-wide banning of naysayers, shutting down of conversation, and encouragement of cheerleading that is seen in the meeting places of other coins and not come to this conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>That’s not to say that Monero doesn’t have cheerleaders itself, because it does. The interesting thing however, is that many community members will call out these cheerleaders and call them to a higher standard of behavior. In fact, Monero goes so far as to consider unnecessarily excessive cheerleading as spammy and will seek to reroute it to more appropriate places, or remove it entirely.</p>\n\n<p>The threat of stunted minds must be taken seriously. Privacy is an arms race where everyone must be on their toes, and cries of “Monero is the best!” and “Nothing can beat Monero! It’s unbreakable!” only detract from the urgency of the battle. Coming from this perspective, a lack of critical thinking and healthy skepticism in a community isn’t just annoying or cultish, it can lead to the fall of the protocol itself.</p>\n\n<p>In many ways, we can look to Bitcoin for examples of how this plays out in real life. Bitcoin maximalists will often spout and virtue signal to each other about Bitcoin’s merits, and whenever issues of privacy, fungibility, or scaling come up the questions are hand-waved away and the offenders are ousted from the community. All too often have people with legitimate questions found themselves banned, blocked, or otherwise ostracized from participation in Bitcoin communities, just because they wouldn’t fall into line on the agreed upon rhetoric and dared to ask questions.</p>\n\n<p>Time and again, these weary travelers find their way to Monero, and, after spending some time in the community, have praised the project for its level-headed discussions and lack of fear from uncomfortable questions. It’s not unheard of for these travelers to even want to discuss other coins, not because they want to shill, but because they grow to trust the reason and logic of the community and want honest opinions of another coin, something they can’t get in the coin’s community itself.</p>\n\n<p>Even the fact that Monero has continually hard forked in the past and present has shown the humility and power of the project. While some may decry hard forks as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/why-monero-is-open-source-and-decentralized\" class=\"next-link\">centralization on developers</a>, which is true to an extent, it shows that the developers understood that the odds of them getting everything 100% right on the first go is slim. Things will need to be improved, and maybe even replaced entirely if Monero wants to remain competitive in both the privacy and cryptocurrency spaces.</p>\n\n<p>Often times, these changes break backwards compatibility, a big no-no in the Bitcoin protocol, where everything has to be a soft fork and backwards compatible. But this means that each individual change that Bitcoin makes to itself has very limited reach in scope. They are weighed down by their past, and improvements must honor it, often times senselessly. Whereas Monero’s changes can be sweeping, and will often times improve the protocol and privacy by several orders of magnitude.</p>\n\n<p>This can be seen easily in the inclusion of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/monero-ringct\" class=\"next-link\">RingCT</a>. Before, Monero only included <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/monero-stealth-addresses\" class=\"next-link\">stealth addresses</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/ring-signatures\" class=\"next-link\">ring signatures</a>, and amounts were visible. Shen Noether, an MRL researcher, modified an existing protocol that hides amounts for Monero, but it’s inclusion would break backwards compatibility, meaning old-style transaction with transparent amounts wouldn’t be allowed anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Monero took this risk, and the end result was a much improved privacy that solidified Monero’s position as the king of privacy coins. But that’s not all it showed. This fork, as well as the several after, as well as all of the following encouragement of skepticism, humility, and questioning within the community, also solidified Monero as one of the sharpest, most critical collection of minds in the cryptospace.</p>'**

It’s not able to show to who, and how much, but there are some cases where the knowledge of someone using Monero is enough to cause harm. \n<br/><br/>\nThe good news is, that if this information is not gleaned the moment the transaction is made, then it cannot be learned at a later date, since IP addresses are not stored on the blockchain. It is also comforting to know that such an attack is unlikely to be seen in the wild, as, in order to pull it off, the attacker would need a large majority of nodes on the network. If a person was able to command this large majority, however, they would be able to identify the “direction” a transaction came from.\n<br/><br/>\nThis may be confusing, so we’ll explain some background info here. Each node connects to other nodes on the network, so that they can keep their blockchain up to date, as well as share what they know with others. These connections allow them to learn about new transactions, propagate them, and send their own. Since a node can only tell their peers about transactions they know about, it stands to reason that the very first node that propagates a transaction is the node that is actually sending Monero.\n<br/><br/>\nIf an attacker owns a large majority of nodes on the network, each node will hear about a transaction from one of their peers, and based on the timing in which each node receives this information, they can deduce likely candidates for where the transaction started.\n<br/><br/>\nIf this is still confusing, we offer this example. Suppose we both have a mutual friend that is hiding from our vision. This friend calls out loudly. I hear his call first, and I hear it louder than you do. From this information, we can know that I am likely closer to our friend than you are. The fact that you hear the sound later (even by just a split second) and the sound is fainter means that we should start our search around my area, not yours.\n<br/><br/>\nIf an attacker is able to successfully guess which of their peers sent the transaction, since they have the IP address that is connected to their node and forwarded it to them, they can be certain of the IP address that sent it. This is powerful information, as IP addresses contains information about the country and internet service provider (ISP) of the user, and the ISP themselves know which user is linked to which exact IP address, effectively deanonymizing the Monero user.'**

This makes it so that even if an attacker can deduce a source IP address, it’s probably not the one that made the transaction, but rather the outproxy (I2P) or exit node (Tor) of the overlay network. This is not an all-encompassing solution however, as overlay networks, VPNs, and similar software is banned in many countries, and expecting everyone to use, sync, and propagate on these networks is unrealistic.  There needs to be a solution that doesn’t require the usage of external software and networks; one that is available to the common person.\n<br/><br/>\nThis solution is Dandelion++ (DPP), which is an upgraded protocol to the original Dandelion proposal for Bitcoin. In this protocol, there are two phases, the stem phase, and the fluff phase; both of them together are supposed to represent the form of a dandelion.\n<br/><br/>\nIn the stem phase, every few minutes, the sending node randomly chooses two peers out of all of the nodes it’s connected to. When the sending node sends a transaction, either on behalf of itself or just forwarding the transaction from another node in the stem phase, it randomly chooses one of these two selected peers and sends the transaction to it.\n<br/><br/>\nThe fluff phase is when a node receives a transaction and broadcasts it to every outgoing connection, rather than just to one randomly chosen one, this allows true transaction propagation. Every few minutes a node defines itself as one that will either propagate via stem or via fluff at random, so a stem phase can be quite long if each connecting node has defined itself as a stem node, but once the transaction hits the fluff phase, it stays there.\n<br/><br/>\nThis means that an attacker will not be able to simply listen for the direction of a transaction anymore, because before it was propagated to everyone, it underwent the stem phase, and the originating node of the fluff phase is not the node the transaction originated from, and it is unknown how many hops along the stem the transaction underwent.\n<br/><br/>\nOf course, combining the solutions above (DPP plus an overlay network) will give even stronger guarantees of privacy and protection against IP tracing. It should also be noted, that DPP does not defend against another form of network tracing attack that can be done with ISPs, but this is beyond the scope of this article.\n<br/><br/>\nDandelion++ is set to go live on the Monero network, and be used by default on the reference client, in the 0.16 release. This small change will further mitigate the attacks possible on the Monero network, and exemplifies why Monero leads the pack in practical, applied privacy technologies.'**

  /// **'<p>When most people think of what sets Monero apart, they think of Monero’s privacy technology. Indeed, most would consider the privacy, and the fungibility that it unlocks, as Monero’s defining trait, and the main weapon it brings into the ring when compared to other coins. What most people might not know is that Monero contains other protocol differences from Bitcoin and its derivatives that some might argue are just as important as Monero’s privacy technologies. In this article, we will look at one of these: the tail emission.</p>\n\n<p>First, let’s define what this term means. A tail emission is an unceasing subsidy of block rewards, even after the ‘last’ Monero is minted. In other words, Monero’s block reward will never fall to zero, but rather fall until it reaches 0.6 XMR per block, and then stay there forever. Miners will always be paid to mine Monero, and will never have to solely rely on a fee market.</p>\n\n<p>But let’s take a step back for a moment, and look at mining on a very high level. Monero miners are incentivized to secure a network by mining hashes. The incentive is the opportunity to make Monero if they find a new block. This Monero is awarded in two ways. Firstly, the miner receives the paid fees of every user who paid for their transaction\'s inclusion in the block. These are the transaction fees that you pay when you send a transaction. Secondly, the miner receives a predetermined amount of Monero from the protocol itself. In most cases, this ‘block reward’ is substantially higher than the user transaction fees, and is where miners make the most money. This block reward serves to keep the miners financially invested in the chain’s security, but also to get new coins into circulation.</p>\n\n<p>In most cryptocurrency protocols, this block reward is set to decrease over time. Most Bitcoin derivatives have what are called halvenings, predetermined points in time where the block reward halves (such as from 20 BTC to 10 BTC). These halvenings happen every few years, and every time it happens, the security on the network decreases. Why? Well, we encourage the reader to read our <a class=\"next-link\" href=\"/knowledge/monero-mining-randomx\" target=\"_blank\">article on Mining and RandomX</a>, and in doing so they will learn that mining is a race. Block rewards are only given out to those who find a block, and there are many entities in competition to do so. When the rewards are higher, more people are interested in playing this game, whereas when the rewards are low, less people, even those with the equipment to do so, will be willing to use their time and resources on a chance to win a measly prize.</p>\n\n<p>Already we begin to scratch the surface of the reason for Monero’s tail emission. Monero too has a decreasing block reward, although unlike Bitcoin there are no halvenings. Instead, each block reward is a tiny amount less than the previous one, so the reduction is much smoother. But the question for all cryptocurrencies is: “What happens when the block reward hits zero?” This is a strange situation in which we both know and don’t know the answer. The part we know is that there will be no more block reward subsidy, which means miners will have to be incentivized by the user transaction fees alone. What we don’t know is if these amounts will be enough to keep the miners securing the chain.</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned earlier, at present time, the block reward outweighs the transaction fees by a substantial amount, so the hope is that, as more users use the chain, fees would increase, and with increased fees the miners will deem it worth their time to continue mining. There is another side to this scenario however, the side of the users. If fees increase, then it will become much more expensive to transact with cryptocurrency for everyone, potentially walling it off from those without sufficient monetary resources. But on the other hand, if the fees stay low and the block reward goes to zero, then very few miners will secure the network, leaving it vulnerable to 51% attacks and reversed transactions.</p>\n\n<p>Nobody has good answers for this scenario, and no major coin has yet entered this phase of their cryptocurrency\'s life, so we have no real-world experience with it either. It’s all speculation. A gamble. Bitcoin makes the bet that the fees will be enough to sustain the miners, even if it means excluding the impoverished. Monero makes a different bet. Monero bets that the fees alone would not be enough for chain security, so it includes a tail emission as part of the protocol.</p>\n\n<p>We remind the reader that the block reward will not fall below 0.6 XMR per block, ever. Will this be enough to incentivize miners? We don’t know, but it’s certainly better than 0, which is what almost every other currency has built in to their protocol.</p>\n\n<p>The main criticism levied against this approach is that this means Monero’s supply is theoretically infinite, causing inflation over time, while coins that cap the block reward have a finite supply, their scarcity increasing the value over time. We feel this argument is insufficient for several reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, what good is a scarce, high-value coin that is easily attacked, censored, and subverted due to low security? If anything, the low security would decrease the value, more than offsetting what increase the scarcity would provide. Secondly, though Monero’s supply is theoretically infinite, the inflation is linear and trends toward zero as a yearly percentage, unlike fiat which is exponential.</p>\n\n<p>Monero’s inflation is precisely known ahead of time, and can be accurately projected, unlike fiat which may increase by more or less on a given year based on the whims of the powers that be. This still preserves the cypherpunk spirit of removing the possibility of human corruption through protocol enforced technology. With the added benefit of the peace of mind that the security of Monero’s blockchain through mining will be around as long as the world needs it.</p>\n\n<p>The last point we want to touch on is one of fairness. Money is used in several ways, as a store of value, as a medium of exchange, and as a unit of account. In a system where supply is finite, inflation will stop, meaning that those that use it as a store of value use the system for free. They benefit from the continued security provided by the miners without paying anything for it, since without inflation, their money does not slowly lose value over time. Conversely, anyone who uses the currency as a medium of exchange gets penalized (via potentially high transaction fees). This will encourage people to hold but not spend, and skews the fairness of the system to favor holders. By having a tail emission, this evens out the equation. Now holders also pay a small tax, via inflation, for the system\'s security. The tail emission makes it more fair for everyone.</p>'**

Not only is Monero’s development done in an open fashion, with frequent meetings that anyone can attend and speak in, but so is its research and implementation. Indeed, many of Monero’s largest breakthroughs have come from external sources via collaboration, or by a seemingly random person coming onto the research platforms with a new idea, such as bulletproofs and privacy optimizations.'**

This coin implemented the protocol described in the paper, on a brand new codebase (i.e. not forked from Bitcoin like most other coins at the time).</p>\n\n<p>The Bytecoin team took their time putting the rest of the code on their repository, but seemed to be done by March of 2014, when the project was subsequently ‘discovered’ by a ‘random’ person on the BitcoinTalk forums, though it is now widely suspected that this was a plant to generate interest. After the sockpuppet succeeded in garnering eyeballs, those newly interested people discovered something strange: over 80% of the coins had already been mined.</p>\n\n<p>This was an astronomical amount, and many were willing to write it off as a scam and move on; that is until the Bytecoin team showed up. They claimed that the reason so much of the coin had been mined by this point was because Bytecoin was actually not a new coin with a massive premine, but had actually existed on the deep web for two years, since 2012.</p>\n\n<p>Long story short, these claims were not well received, as nobody had heard of Bytecoin before, and it didn’t take long before people lost interest. Not everyone was willing to completely give up however. Some began looking over the Cryptonote protocol that Bytecoin was based on and concluded that the protocol itself seemed to be solid and innovative, even if the first implementation wasn’t. </p>\n\n<p>At that point, it was a race to see who could fork Bytecoin, clean up the code, and be the first ‘non-scam’ version to market, in order to gain a first mover advantage.</p>'**

While the need for censorship-resistance may be a bit\nlost on those of us in “free” countries, the rapid slide toward\nauthoritarianism and political decay in many parts of the world is\nmaking it more apparent by the day that we need a way to transact with\nor without governmental approval.</p>\n<p>If you do not hold your own keys, however, a government or regulator\ncan easily force an exchange or custodian to blacklist your funds, seize\nthem, or censor transactions to specific addresses. This is already\nhappening broadly due to state-level sanctions today, and will be an\nincreasing theme as governments and regulators realize that exchanges\nand custodians are the easiest path towards control over Monero’s\nusage.</p>\n<p>The day could also come where a government will outlaw self-custody\nof Monero, and if you haven’t yet withdrawn your Monero from an exchange\nor custodian you may not ever be able to.</p>\n<h6 id=\"it-prevents-simple-theft-or-confiscation-of-your-monero\">It\nprevents simple theft or confiscation of your Monero</h6>\n<p>A hypothetical, but possible, scenario could be the worst-case for\nthose who choose not to hold their own keys – their Monero getting\nstolen by a hacker or confiscated by a government with a <a class=\"next-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" \nhref=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102\">6102-like\norder</a>.</p>\n<p><a class=\"next-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" \nhref=\"https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/\">Almost\n\$500 million</a> in cryptocurrency was stolen from centralized exchanges\nin 2021, and \$3.2 billion total stolen from users who gave up custody of\nfunds for one reason or another.

If an exchange holds the keys\nto your funds, those funds can be stolen by a hacker (or the exchange\nthemselves!) at any time.</p>\n<p>If you hold your own keys, the only real risks of theft or\nconfiscation are scams and physical attacks, something that is much less\nlikely and usually only happens to high-profile individuals or those\nharmed by the theft or loss of know-your-customer (KYC) data from\ncentralized exchanges that links their ID and address with\ncryptocurrency ownership.</p>\n<h6\nid=\"it-prevents-exchanges-leveraging-fractional-reserve-lending-and-trading\">It\nprevents exchanges leveraging fractional reserve lending and\ntrading</h6>\n<p>Another important aspect of holding your own keys is one that is less\npersonal and more communal.

What matters is that the security comes from hashes generated by computers (miners), in competition with one another to find the mathematical solution necessary to create another block.

Some computers are powerful enough to run AI networks or intense games, while others struggle with even simple tasks. These differences in computing power also affect the hash rate, or the rate at which they look for block solutions. <br/><br/>\nBut even these differences between computers pale in comparison to the hash rates of specialized hardware, otherwise known as Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which outclass regular computers by several orders of magnitude.<br/><br/>\nLet’s take some time to explore what makes ASICs so powerful. Imagine all computers as falling somewhere on a spectrum, which ranges from being able to do many things, but nothing well, to doing only one thing, but doing it very well. CPUs and ASICs are on opposite ends of this spectrum.<br/><br/>\nCPUs that are in all standard computers are on the first end. They can do many things, like browse the web, play games, or render video, but not do any of them particularly well. But this flexibility comes at the cost of efficiency.<br/><br/>\nASICs are on the other end, where they can just one thing, but do it at an incredible rate. They can only perform one mathematical function, but because they can ignore everything else, the performance gains are astronomical. This efficiency however, does come at the cost of flexibility, so if the function changes even slightly – an example is x + y = z changes to 2x + y = z – then the ASIC will cease to function altogether. <br/><br/>\nNot everyone owns an ASIC, but everyone does own computers. This can lead to an unfair advantage.'**

Imagine a lottery where one thousand dollars is awarded every hour, and this lottery allows you to print your own tickets! You start printing as many tickets as you can on your home printer, which can print one ticket per second. After subtracting electricity and ink costs, you see that you can still make a profit, even if you only win the lottery once every few weeks.<br/><br/>\nOver time, you expand your operation until you have an entire room dedicated to printers. 20 in all. Everything is fine...until one fateful day.<br/><br/>\nThere’s big news. Someone has invented a new kind of printer. It can only print lottery tickets. It can’t print pictures, or office documents, or do double sided printing. Only lottery tickets. But it can print them at a rate of 1000 tickets per second. You look in your little printer room. 20 printers. You need 980 more printers just to keep up with ONE of these monster printers, and if someone has two…?<br/><br/>\nYou sadly exit the lottery game as you can no longer justify the electricity and ink costs.<br/><br/>\nBut wait! A couple of weeks later there’s more news! The design of the ticket has changed. Now the numbers, which used to be on the top, are now on the bottom. The new monster printers are so inflexible they can’t do it. They could only make the previous design. It’s not long before you’re once again happily printing away. At least until someone makes a new monster printer for the new design.'**

It does this by requiring miners to make and execute random code in place of hashing based off of an algorithm.<br/><br/>\nIt may be confusing how this actually helps anything, so let’s go back to our printer analogy. Remember what happened when the design changed? The old monster printers become obsolete every night, and new ones had to be developed with the new design in mind. What would happen if every new lottery prize ticket, had to adhere to a new design standard for every new jackpot? <br/><br/>\nCreating a new monster printer would become incredibly difficult. You can’t just plan on one ticket design anymore. Since the design is random, the monster printer makers would have to add color capabilities, ways to print different lettering and borders and shapes and more. In short, the machine they ended up inventing would be a standard, regular printer. Just like everyone else has.<br/><br/>\nBy simply implementing this randomness in the ticket design, we substantially reduced the great advantage gained from specialized hardware. RandomX does the same, but with mining.<br/><br/>\nIn this way, the advantages gained by a select few affluent people is minimized, as if they invest in creating “ASICs” for mining RandomX, they will actually merely invent stronger, better CPUs, which benefits the world at large.<br/><br/>\nThis means the little guy with his 20 ticket printers is back in the game. He may still have a harder time since these wealthy individuals can still buy more printers than him, but at least now he’s not outclassed by orders of magnitude simply from one machine. He’s competitive in his small way.<br/><br/>\nKnowing that even the little guy can be competitive in mining Monero, we encourage everyone to give it a spin, either in the Monero GUI wallet, which has support for solo mining, or by downloading community maintained software.

We do know that cryptocurrencies in general are on the radar of many government agencies, and have reason to believe Monero is, moreso than others, for the above stated reasons, but, as of yet, few moves have been made by the governments of any country in regards to outright banning Monero.</p>\n\n<p>Even so, the Monero community is committed to fighting the good fight.

These people still believe it is private, so they basically believe it to be what Monero actually is, and yet we’re quickly moving into a world where it is gaining acceptance with the public, businesses, and governing bodies.

At one point in time, this website listed an attack on Monero to cost around \$6,300 for one hour. While this price may cause many of us to gawk, it’s not outside the realm of possibility for a wealthy business or individual to be able to conduct a sustained attack on the network.</p>\n\n<p>This, thankfully, is no longer the case.

Once again, the reader is encouraged to read <a class=\"next-link\" href=\"/knowledge/monero-mining-randomx\" target=\"_blank\">our article on RandomX for details</a>, but due to the CPU-friendly nature of the algorithm, no longer can businesses like NiceHash just purchase ASICs for Monero to rent out to whoever is willing to rent them. Now, they have to compete with CPUs, which are much more prevalent and easier to obtain.</p>\n\n<p>The exact cost of hardware to 51% attack the Monero network has not been calculated, and indeed, is not as easily calculated as other coins with ASICs period.</p>'**

If one needs a CPU to mine Monero, then hackers can theoretically take control of many hundreds if not thousands of vulnerable computers and force them to mine Monero on their behalf, costing them nothing, and outcompeting those with only a couple of computers in their households.</p>\n\n<p>The first rebuttal to this argument is about the owners of botnets themselves. While we don’t condone hacking others’ computers, the barrier to entry to owning and operating a botnet is far lower than that of owning ASICs. One requires software – often quite freely available and open source – and the time and an acumen for sniffing out vulnerable computers. The other requires incredible amounts of capital and access to manufacturing. One can be done by a kid in a basement, and the other only by the extremely wealthy. This leads us to conclude that, if the worst fears of miners were to come true, the botnets themselves would be more decentralized than ASICs would be.</p>\n\n<p>That said, the Monero community is confident that this issue is overblown. The engineers of RandomX deliberately designed the protocol to require 2GB of RAM memory to work. In other words, many small, vulnerable virtual private servers (VPS) will simply not have the capacity, and if they did, the uptick in resources used would be very noticeable to a system administrator, leading to immediate investigation. In other words, it can’t run silently in the background like compromised computers taking part in a DDOS attack, or silently sniffing passwords. When the miner is on, everyone knows it.</p>\n\n<p>This reduces the amount of computers a botnet would be able to successfully compromise to those of the greatly technologically inept, or those that are never checked on, rather than the plethora of vulnerable computers that the proponents of this argument assume are at risk.</p>'**

  /// **'<p>This criticism comes from the real-world occurrence. A group of individuals, not known to the community, forked Monero and created their own coin: MoneroV. Since it was a chain fork, individuals were able to claim an equivalent amount of MoneroV as they had in Monero, i.e. if you had 100 Monero, you could use the same seed on a MoneroV wallet to get 100 MoneroV.</p>\n\n<p>This led to a surprising, and unexpected consequence: a loss of privacy. To explain it, we will give an example. If I think of a number that you have to guess, but I give you three numbers, only one of which is correct, you will not know which is the correct answer. Let’s say I tell you the numbers 88, 25, and 19. You are clever however, and ask me for another set of three numbers, but one of them must still be the correct number. I give you 54, 88, and 92. You see that the number 88 appears in both sets, so it must be the correct number, and you would be right.</p>\n\n<p>The attack on Monero’s privacy works the same way. Monero relies on ring signatures, which are assembled on the local wallet to obfuscate transaction outputs. If I was to spend an output on the Monero chain, with one assembled ring, and spend the same output on the MoneroV chain, on a different assembled ring, without making sure that the ring is composed of the same decoys, then the true output becomes obvious, much in the same way the number 88 became obvious as the correct number.</p>\n\n<p>Several solutions were posited, including creating tools for people to fork from Monero responsibly, a blackball database of tainted outputs, and upping the ringsize, but ultimately, none of these were required. MoneroV never gained any traction, and the amount of people who claimed their coins and put their privacy in danger were very few.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that this danger to privacy does NOT come from a code fork of Monero, but rather a chain fork. This means that any coin that takes the code of Monero and starts from scratch with their own genesis block will not put either chain in danger. Only if a coin forks the actual blockchain from the current Monero blockchain because of a disagreement, similar to the Bitcoin / Bitcoin Cash debacle, would the chains be in danger. This would mean the fork would be fighting against the established community, and those that choose not to take part and claim their coins from the other chain would not be in danger.</p>\n\n<p>That said, we do see it as naive to think there will never be an attack on Monero in this way, which is why other solutions are in the works to either increase the ringsize, or move to a different proving scheme altogether, many of which were mentioned in the ‘high transaction fees’ section.</p>'**

The creator, thankful_for_today, was likely in league with a cryptocurrency group that made the CryptoNote protocol, but had devious intentions to scam people out of their money using it.</p>\n\n<p>Their initial coin efforts failed, so they created Monero as a way to try again. This again failed as the community quickly realized something was amiss and took hold of the coin. Even so, the devious creators had one last trick up their sleeve. They released to the public deliberately deoptimized mining software, keeping the optimized version for themselves so as to outmine others and make lots of money off of the block rewards.</p>\n\n<p>This succeeded for a time, but was also quickly caught by the Monero community, fixed, and the optimized miner was released to all. The community, realizing what happened, chose not to relaunch the coin, as it was difficult to gauge both how much the scammers had made off with, and how much time and effort it would take to rebuild from scratch. Despite the difficulty in ascertaining how many coins the scammers received, it is also known that in this period many good-faith miners had independently re-optimized the code themselves, and sold off their profits, ensuring a more fair distribution, and that the scammers were not the only ones to get a large number of coins in this time. <a class=\"next-link\" href=\"https://da-data.blogspot.com/2014/08/minting-money-with-monero-and-cpu.html\" target=\"_blank\">One such account can be read here</a>.\n\n<p>With the benefit of hindsight, some might criticize the decision to not relaunch the coin, and if these scammy origins are enough to push one away from the good work Monero has done, then there is no argument to sway them. Regardless of the initial frustrations the scammer creators caused, Monero has thrived and used its combined community intellect and passion to make a powerful technology. Our current core team, as well as the past members, were not enriched by the cripple mine, and to our knowledge, nobody involved in the initial scam lasted in the Monero community longer than the first few weeks of the coin’s existence.</p>'**

  /// **'<p>This one is the most difficult to answer because of the constant fluctuation of mining in general. In fact, it may be that after this article is published this may not be the case anymore, and the next day it may become the case again. Technology in general is hard to write about definitively due to the fast moving nature of the industry, and this is especially true with mining and hashrate.</p>\n\n<p>We’re not avoiding the concern, don’t worry. Let’s address it by looking at the difference between hardware centralization and pool centralization.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that mining on Bitcoin can only be done on very specific hardware that is not easily accessible means that the best hardware is centralized around the manufactures. Since setting up a mining pool is trivial, we expect to see these manufacturers deploy their own mining pools, on which their ASICs mine, and indeed, we see this to be the case with the major ASIC manufacturing companies today.<p>\n\n<p>This is not a solvable problem. The centralized mining pools own the hardware, the pool, and the hashes, and there is nothing that anyone can do about it.</p>\n\n<p>Pool centralization, while the end result is similar, has very different, and much more changeable underpinnings. Because Monero has egalitarian mining, every miner can choose where to point their hashes. People often choose to point at a bigger pool, simply because this means they will see blocks found more often than a smaller pool. </p>\n\n<p>Although, it should be noted that their individual cut of the block reward will be smaller since they are sharing it with many more people. Smaller pools find blocks less often, but each miner gets a larger portion of the block reward, and the end result is a miner actually makes an equivalent amount of money whether they are on a smaller pool or larger one, so we encourage miners to point their hash to smaller pools to further decentralize the mining.</p>\n\n<p>But we digress.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll notice in our encouragement for decentralization above, the fact that the miner has the power to switch pools. At any point, whether from better education, a rallying call for decentralization, or increased competition amongst pools, the hash distribution can change based off of individual miners changing where they point their hashes. The same can’t be said for mining that is centralized on the hardware level, as the ASIC manufacturers have no incentive to point to any pool other than their own, and they will not do so.</p>\n\n<p>So that fact that the bulk of Monero’s hashrate is concentrated into a couple of pools is not something we are stuck with, and indeed, may be due to lack of education about mining in general. It’s something that can be fixed because the problem does not lie at the root level, unlike with Bitcoin’s hardware centralization.</p>'**

The list is long, confusing, and difficult to get perfectly, with often the consequences for a mistake being compromised privacy. One example of this is the suggestion to tumble or mix your Bitcoin, but after the mixing process, if the resulting outputs are merged or otherwise move into the same wallet, the mixing could have been for naught, as tracing the outputs provide high linkability.

  /// **'<p>This criticism is most commonly given with Bitcoin in mind. What if Bitcoin adopts privacy technologies that allow adequate privacy. What would be the use for Monero?</p>\n\n<p>The reality is, we don’t see Bitcoin ever putting privacy on the first layer. At best, it would be on second layers, or through certain wallets, such as Samourai and Wasabi. This means the privacy is opt-in, which research shows is always inferior to privacy that is on by default. Even if this technology was adopted by a decent percentage of Bitcoin users (which is itself a stretch of the imagination), the privacy would be inferior.</p>\n\n<p>While the reasons for opt-in privacy inferiority would be big enough to make it’s own article, we want to elaborate with a crude example here. Privacy, from a technological standpoint, is about hiding in a crowd. The bigger and more homogeneous the crowd, the better the privacy of the individual. Conversely if either the crowd is small, or large, but everyone wears different, unique clothing, it would be easier to identify an individual.</p>\n\n<p>This means that since Bitcoin is forcing people to take extra steps to be a part of this crowd, many will not do it, and those that do, may do it poorly. The end result ends up being a small crowd, and identifying individual outputs is much easier. But it gets worse. In addition to the crowd being small, every individual is more or less unique from each other, depending on the privacy protocol they chose to use. Some might choose Samourai, which has one way of mixing, while others may choose Wasabi which has another, and the list goes on. This ultimately leads to unique characteristics about each transaction. Coupled with the small crowd, the privacy is quite weak.</p>\n\n<p>We compare the above to Monero, which enforces privacy at a protocol level. This means that everyone is a part of the crowd by default, and everyone utilizes the same privacy (the one dictated by the protocol). The crowd is both large, and homogeneous, resulting in much stronger privacy.</p>\n\n<p>But let’s take a step back and follow a hypothetical, where, somehow, Bitcoin does indeed put privacy on the base layer. It’s robust, on-by default, and mandatory. What would be the need for Monero?</p>\n\n<p>Well, for some, there wouldn’t be one, and it may be surprising to hear, but many of us Monero folks wouldn’t care. All we want is for there to be a privacy preserving, fungible way for individuals to transact with each other across the globe, and if Bitcoin miraculously does it in a way that actually protects privacy through mandatory, base-layer technology, then many of us would happily switch over. Good luck getting this to happen though.</p>\n\n<p>That said, Monero does offer many features beyond privacy that Bitcoin does not. The dynamic blocksize enabled by a tail emission, a different code base, a policy of low fees, a different elliptic curve, and more. In particular the dynamic blocksize should be highlighted here, as it enables a theoretically limitless transaction throughput with only storage and bandwidth being the choke points. In short, a theoretical Bitcoin with privacy just doesn\'t offer everything Monero does.</p>\n\n<p>Switching gears one last time for this question, less often this argument applies to technology like an ethereum smart contract using zk-SNARKS, which, once again, does not have mandatory privacy on the base layer of the main chain, so the anonymity sets will be quite small and of dubious ability to adequately protect privacy. For other comparisons, please see our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/why-monero-is-better\" class=\"next-link\">article comparing Monero to the other major privacy coins</a>.</p>'**

  /// **'<p>In the 2017-2018 era, the Monero community made a commitment to keep ASICs off of the network. This was done by continuously hard forking every six months to a new proof-of-work algorithm, which would stop ASICs from taking over the network. The printer analogy in our <a class=\"next-link\" href=\"/knowledge/monero-mining-randomx\" target=\"_blank\">article on mining in Monero</a> explains how this works.</p>\n\n<p>What most people don\'t know is that Monero\'s hard forks did not begin for the reasons of changing its proof-of-work. Monero had been hard forking every six months prior to this as well, going back as far as 2015. Why do these hard forks in the first place? Ask any person that works on privacy and they will tell you that privacy is an arms race. One side makes good privacy, the other develops tools that can break said privacy, causing the first side to develop stronger technology, and the cycle goes on and on.</p>\n\n<p>A major example of pre-PoW change hard forks is the inclusion of RingCT in 2017, arguably the biggest changes to Monero ever that increased Monero\'s privacy by many orders of magnitude. We simply think it’s too soon to ossify the protocol, especially with exciting new privacy technologies in the works, such as Triptych and Lelantus. That said, we work hard to ensure our development, research, and more are as decentralized as possible. We have <a class=\"next-link\" href=\"/knowledge/why-monero-is-open-source-and-decentralized\" target=\"_blank\">an article that covers that topic</a> as well, so be sure to check it out.</p>\n\n<p>All this to say, the decentralized development team is finding it too difficult and exhausting to keep up this schedule and is looking to transition to a hard fork every nine months or even every year. This is because the community feels, with advancements like Triptych and Arcturus, we\'re getting close to what we are hoping will be a truly robust privacy with few weak points, leading to the lack of necessity for sustained, protocol-changing development. And on the proof-of-work front several community members created RandomX as a last gambit to keep ASICs off of the network. At time of writing, we’re still in the middle of this experiment, and have yet to see if it will be successful in the long term, but one of the desired results has come to pass, another reason for rapid forking removed, enabling a slower forking schedule.</p>'**

  /// **'<p>Blockchain is a myriad of disciplines all squeezed together into one. It brings elements of technology, economics, and game theory into its security models. This means that it is one of the most involved and intricate pieces of technology to date, but also means that a deep and thorough understanding is impossible without learning the fundamentals of each puzzle piece that shapes it.</p>\n\n<p>One part of blockchain that is not often discussed is competition. Each cryptocurrency is often evaluated on its own merits, and even against the cryptocurrencies most like it, but few are evaluated based on what they offer the market as a whole, and how many people are using it. Taken further, a cryptocurrency must analyze how many use it, know about it, or otherwise interface with it in any way. This concept is known as a network effect.</p>\n\n<p>A non-blockchain example of a network effect is social media. If all of your friends are on Facebook, then when you are choosing which social media you want to be heavily involved in, your friends\' choices factor into this decision also. The fact that most of them are on Facebook may influence you to join it as well. And when you are deciding whether or not you want to leave the platform, the fact that you might lose contact with some of these friends will also influence this decision. This is the network effect in action. After adoption reaches a critical mass, further adoption becomes easier and is often fueled by the network\'s current participants.</p>\n\n<p>When we look at this in the context of blockchain, and indeed commerce in general, the power of network effects quickly becomes evident. If Bitcoin is the crypto that most people know about, and is the one that most people buy, then more merchants will accept it. If more merchants accept it then there is more places to use it, so more people will buy it, and more people will know about it. It becomes a big positive feedback loop that snowballs. At this point, a merchant might be approached about using another cryptocurrency but will question why it\'s needed since they already accept Bitcoin and it’s what everyone uses and accepts. </p>\n\n<p>While it is undisputed that Bitcoin is far and away the largest cryptocurrency, there are others that are considered top in their niche. Monero is one such coin, being considered by many to be the premiere privacy coin, though different people have varying opinions about whether or not Monero is even competing in the same space as Bitcoin. This is because Bitcoin has placed all its cards on its transparency for the sake of verifying the total amount (though this is also possible in Monero, albeit in a much more roundabout way).</p>\n\n<p>So where does Monero currently stand in this game of network effects? Where did we start? What does the future hold? Well, let’s start at the beginning.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s interesting to note that in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/monero-history\" class=\"next-link\">Monero\'s early days</a>, it was one of three ways to do privacy. Coinjoin, CryptoNote, and Dash\'s masternode/coinjoin hybrid. The options were limited, and definitely not peer-reviewed, but that didn’t stop people from choosing a side. In this older era, it was anybody’s game, and some decided to sit back and let the cream rise to the top. Time eventually proved to be on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/why-monero-is-better\" class=\"next-link\">Monero’s side</a>, as other privacy cryptocurrencies came and went.</p>\n\n<p>This established Monero’s network effect as the coin paving the way for others in privacy. Even as newer technology came along, such as Zcash’s zk-SNARKs, and MimbleWimble, the masses looked to Monero for leadership and sane discussion on these new protocols.</p>\n\n<p>At present time, Monero is one of the few universally respected projects in the space. From crypto noobies to Bitcoin maximalists, all of them view Monero with at least a begrudging respect, though more often it’s with higher acknowledgments. When veterans of the space talk about the coins that have the highest chance of making a difference in the world, and will last through trial and tribulation, Monero never fails to be present.</p>\n\n<p>These last few paragraphs are not just self-congratulatory, but an honest look at what the crypto landscape is like at time of writing. The network effects of Monero are becoming more and more apparent every day, and show up in unexpected places.</p>\n\n<p>People are quite divided when it comes to Monero’s future, but all opinions point to Monero doing its job well. The biggest example of this is regulatory concerns. Some are afraid that Monero is too private, which will cause an inevitable clash with the governments of the world, while others are excited for how this privacy brings freedom back to the common person. At the root of both of these views is the idea that Monero fully delivers on its promise of privacy and fungibility, and it is often the only coin in such conversations as most other ‘privacy coins’ do not.</p>\n\n<p>As Monero’s community tries very hard to be <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/critical-thinking\" class=\"next-link\">rational and skeptical</a>, it is not afraid of new technology. Other coins, who care more about the competitive side speak constantly of ‘dethroning’ Monero, and how Monero should be scared of their new tech that will take over the privacy world. In other words, they think their new tech will overcome Monero\'s established network effects in the privacy circles.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily relies on its network effects to stay relevant without much underlying innovation, Monero has decided to embrace both. New, vetted technology is added to make Monero more private and secure, ensuring that Monero’s network effects are never the sole purpose for its status, but rather a result of innovation and hard work.</p>\n\n<p>In this sense, one has to wonder how long a technology like Bitcoin can rely solely on its existing network effects to stay relevant. The case is presently strong, with no coin coming even close to matching Bitcoin’s brand recognition and collective brain space, but we must remember that many other juggernauts in other industries thought themselves untouchable, only to face their own downfall due to lack of innovation.</p>'**

  /// **'<p>It shouldn\'t come as a surprise to anyone that Monero, and indeed all cryptocurrency, runs on the internet. And yet, even though this statement seems basic and obvious, many do not consider the implications of what this means in regards to their privacy. In other words, there are some things Monero can and can\'t protect against, just by nature of running on the internet. Some of these considerations are mere inconveniences, while others are much more serious in a scenario where absolute privacy is required. Let\'s take the time to get familiar with how Monero users interact with each other on the network, and what this means for their privacy.</p>\n\n<p>Starting on the trivial side of things, if a user does not have access to the internet, they cannot download new blocks, propagate transactions on behalf of others, or send transactions of their own. An interesting thing to note is, a user with a full node, without internet access can construct a transaction offline that can be sent later. This is because a ring signature only needs outputs from the blockchain to hide with. A brief reminder on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/ring-signatures\" class=\"next-link\">how ring signatures work</a>, it hides the real output that a user is sending among a collection of unaffiliated outputs chosen from the past. If the user has access to these outputs in the form of a fully downloaded blockchain (full node) then they can create the ring signature from the past outputs, and once internet connectivity resumes, propagate the transaction to the network.</p>\n\n<p>A user that is using a remote node cannot do this, as when they construct their ring signature, they contact the remote full node for outputs to include in the ring signature. No internet means they can\'t reach this node, so they do not have offline transaction construction capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Before we continue into some of the privacy considerations, let\'s have a brief primer on how the internet works as a whole. The entire internet is nothing more than computers connecting to other computers. That\'s it. The blog you like to read? Just some files hosted on someone else\'s computer. This website you\'re reading this article on (LocalMonero)? Files and code hosted on a computer somewhere. Even big crazy sites work this way. Take YouTube for example. Just video files hosted on Google\'s gigantic computer systems, and you connect to them to download the video to your own computer so you can watch it.</p>\n\n<p>These computers can tell each other apart because each and every computer connected to the internet is given a unique identification number called an IP address. These typically are four sets of numbers separated by periods, for example: 172.66.35.7. It\'s important to keep this in mind when we consider how Monero information is moved around the internet. Monero is a peer-to-peer network (P2P), meaning computers connect directly to each other rather than using an intermediary. So when a user\'s full node is downloading a newly discovered block, they aren\'t downloading it from a central server, but from their peers. The downside to this is, since users are connecting to each other directly, they know each other’s IP addresses.</p>\n\n<p>Well? What\'s the big deal? It\'s just a number, right? Not exactly. IP addresses themselves contain information about the user, such as the originating country, and network provider, but, even worse, internet service providers (ISPs) know the IP address of each person using their services. This means these ISPs and those that they work with can watch a user\'s internet traffic and, using some clever tactics, discover that they are using Monero. Now before you get scared, note the wording there. All these snoopers can do is see that a person is connecting to other nodes on the Monero network. Because of Monero\'s privacy technology, nothing else is leaked about the individual. Not whether or not they are running a node, or if/when they send transactions, and if a transaction is sent, none of its information is known. All these ISPs can see is that one of their users is connecting to the Monero network.</p>\n\n<p>Now, for some people, in some locations, this information alone may be enough to cause damage to reputation or freedom. Or perhaps the idea of anyone invading your privacy and what you do on the internet, for any reason, is not acceptable to you. These individuals are encouraged to only connect to the Monero network using VPNs, Tor, or I2P, all of which are services that hide a user\'s IP address from others as well as hide what a user is doing from their ISP. The differences between these services is beyond the scope of this article, but there are plenty of high quality articles written on the topic, so concerned users are encouraged to study up!</p>\n\n<p>For the rest of us, we may think that having others know we are connected to the Monero network isn’t that big of a deal. After all, the actual contents of our transactions, or if we’re sending any at all, are hidden to the public, so what\'s the harm? While this may be true, users are encouraged to consider the fact that the main draw of cryptocurrencies is being their own bank. When you hold your private key, and if something happens to it, nobody can help you recover your lost funds.</p>\n\n<p>Being your own bank means considering, not just your digital security, but your physical security as well. It could very well be that the knowledge of an individual connecting to the Monero network may bring unwanted attention, not necessarily from large scale actors like nation states, but smaller ones with selfish interest, like hackers looking to make an easy buck. There are indeed countless stories all over the crypto space of such scenarios actually taking place.</p>\n\n<p>This article is not intended to fearmonger or frighten, but rather encourage users to do some research on what methods of web surfing protection are right for them. The good news is, that these skills will transfer to general internet usage as well, not just Monero usage, and as such, in our increasingly internet connected world, a savvy user can’t go wrong accumulating the proper knowledge and skills to stay safe and truly be their own bank.</p>'**

  /// **'<p>When using a remote node, there are a few key pieces of information that get exposed to a remote node and a couple of key ways that node can attack you, prevent you from transacting, and more.</p>\n<p>The first thing a remote node can learn about you is your public IP address. While this will hopefully be concealed via a VPN or Tor, the remote node could associate your public IP address with the transaction, helping them to narrow down where you are transacting from. The remote node can also learn the last block your wallet synced and use this to try and make educated guesses about you, such as when you normally use Monero and when you last spent Monero. This is especially true if you are always coming from the same IP address (such as your home). The last key thing that a remote node can learn about you is basic information about the transactions you send through it. While this may be the most obvious data that the remote node operator gets about you, it’s important to understand that this could be used to help track down the sender of the transaction when combining that information with other off-chain data. This can be especially dangerous if the remote node is run by a malicious entity, a blockchain analytics company, or an oppressive nation-state.</p>\n<p>A remote node can also attempt to cause you trouble by hiding blocks from you, making your wallet think it was synced when it wasn’t. This can make you think funds are lost or prevent you from spending funds until you connect to another node. The last key thing a remote node could do is feed your wallet a manipulated list of decoys. This could cause your wallet to either fail completely to build transactions (making you unable to spend funds), or could allow the remote node to try and provide decoys it knows are spent to reduce the anonymity you receive in each transaction.</p>'**

  /// **'<p>While this article may have scared you a bit, it’s important to realize that the privacy provided by Monero is excellent even when using a remote node, and far surpasses any other cryptocurrency when used this way. You still gain the strong on-chain privacy provided by Monero, as the remote node never knows the true input (what coins you’re spending), the amount of Monero spent in the transaction, or the address of the recipient of the transaction. Outside observers also cannot see the true input, amount, or addresses involved (no matter what type of node you choose to use!), ensuring that outside of the remote node even your IP address, wallet sync information, and transactions have strong privacy guarantees.</p>\n<p>The remote node also never has access to the previous transactions you’ve sent or received or the amount of Monero currently in your wallet, and loses all visibility into your transactions the moment you start to use another node. No private keys (either spend or view keys) are ever provided to the remote node, and so your wallet remains private, secure, and usable. No matter the remote node, you also are never at risk of losing Monero or having it stolen, as the node cannot edit the recipient address, never has access to your wallets private keys, and cannot confiscate your Monero in any way.</p>'**

The name light wallet comes from the fact that your wallet (on your phone or computer) does not have to perform any of the blockchain synchronization, making the experience faster and more fluid.</p>\n<p>However, wallets like this come with a severe privacy trade-off for now – your wallet sends the private view key to the remote server you use (like the default in MyMonero), giving the remote server full visibility into any received funds since the creation of your wallet (and until you stop using that wallet or seed). This does reduce the privacy you receive from the node operator drastically, and should be approached with caution.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, the Monero community is working on improving the software you can use to host your own light wallet server (LWS), which will allow you to have fast synchronization without trusting a 3rd-party with your private view keys – as you will run the software where your wallet sends the private view keys!</p>\n<p>For more on the custom light wallet server, see the below Github repository:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"next-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/vtnerd/monero-lws\">monero-lws</a></li>\n</ul>'**

  /// **'<p>Monero, like other cryptocurrencies, uses outputs as a means of accounting for funds. Many crypto savvy users have probably heard this term before, but not everyone understands what they mean and how they work. As explored in our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/ring-signatures\" class=\"next-link\">ring signatures article</a>, outputs are the actual unit exchanged on the blockchain between transacting parties. Similar to a dollar bill, but the amount is not in a fixed denomination.</p>\n\n<p>If you get paid \$16 for a job, you might receive a one dollar bill, a five dollar bill, and a ten dollar bill. You have \$16, but you also have three different bills in your wallet. If you wanted to pay someone 6 dollars, you could use the 5 and the 1 bill, but if you wanted to pay someone \$8 you could only use the \$10 and receive \$2 back in change. Lastly, if you wanted to pay someone \$14 you would have to use all three bills, and would receive \$2 back in change, but for a moment, when you hand over all three bills, you have no money in your wallet until you get the change back.</p>\n\n<p>Monero works similarly. Suppose you run a store and make three sales on three different items. You might receive 1.5 XMR, 2.25 XMR, and 5.25 XMR for a total of 9 XMR, but you also have three different outputs in your wallet of the denominations stated previously. Just like with the dollars, you might want to pay someone 3 XMR. You could use just the 5.25 XMR output, and receive 2.25 XMR back in change, or you could combine the 1.5 and 2.25 XMR outputs and get 0.75 XMR back in change.</p>\n\n<p>But, as soon as you send the transaction, the outputs that you do use are put in a \"locked\" state, meaning they are inaccessible until you receive back the change. The protocol unlocks the funds (i.e. gives you back the change) after 10 confirmations, or around 20 minutes. Just like once you hand over the dollar bills out of your wallet, you cannot use the money again until you receive the change back from the cashier, your Monero is inaccessible until you receive back the change.</p>\n\n<p>Let\'s go back to the example of sending 3 XMR to someone, and you use the 5.25 XMR output. Now, while you wait for you 1.75 XMR back in change, you cannot use it. This 1.75 XMR is inaccessible to you. But you can still use the 1.5 XMR and 2.25 XMR outputs, as these were not spent. Going back to the dollar example, if you paid someone \$8, as in the example before, you would not be able to use the \$2 that you expect back in change until it is given to you, but in this example, you still have a \$10 bill that is unused in your wallet. This can still be used to purchase whatever you want while you wait for the change. The same with Monero.</p>\n\n<p>This is often a point of confusion for new Monero users. Often, a user may just have one output in their wallet, received from an exchange or a friend. Let\'s say this output is 20 XMR. They have no other outputs in their wallet. They now want to make a donation to two of their favorite charities. They send 5 XMR to the first charity and then are confused because, even though they should have 15 XMR left, they cannot immediately send the next donation to the second charity. As you might have guessed, this is because the 15 XMR is locked. It cannot be spent until it is returned as change (10 confirmations or around 20 minutes). After their funds are unlocked, they would be able to send their second donation.</p>\n\n<p>Just to reiterate the point, they would not have had this problem if they had had multiple outputs instead, such as two 10 XMR outputs or similar. They would be able to send both donations one right after the other, because the first donation would use one of the 10 XMR outputs (and wait 10 confirmations to receive 5 XMR back in change), and the second donation would use the other 10 XMR output.</p>\n\n<p>Some cryptocurrency wallets have a feature called ‘output management’, which simply shows a user which outputs they currently have (in addition to their total sum), as well as allows them to choose which ones they want to use when they spend their cryptocurrency.</p>\n\n<p>As of now, the Monero GUI does output selection for users automatically, as users selecting their own outputs often leads to confusion or, in some cases, harmed privacy. There are wallets under construction however, such as the new Feather wallet project, that will contain these output management features.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve been talking a lot about the sending portion, but something fascinating happens on the receiving end. Going back to our example of sending 3 XMR to someone, and using your 1.5 XMR and 2.25 XMR outputs in the transaction (while expecting 0.75 XMR in change), the receiver does NOT receive two outputs of 1.5 XMR and 2.25 XMR. They instead receive ONE 3 XMR output.</p>\n\n<p>In the background, the protocol combines all outputs used for spending, and gives the receiver one output of the paid amount, and sends one change output back to the sender. So the sender will also receive one output back as change, regardless of whether they used two, three, or ten outputs to send the transaction.</p>\n\n<p>We hope this has cleared up some confusion about outputs and how the internal accounting of the protocol works, as well as the common user facing problem of confusion when encountering locked funds. In another article, we will explore managing your outputs so as to minimize the chance of having to wait for unlocked funds before sending future transactions.</p>'**

  /// **'<p>In the realm of privacy, it\'s often far too easy to accidentally leak or reveal data about yourself that can be used to identify you. An old example that no longer applies to Monero is custom ringsizes. If the default is 11, and everyone uses 11, but you consistently use 54, yes the number is higher so your anonymity set is higher, but now you stand apart from the crowd and your transactions are easier to identify. Monero has since made an update to fix the ringsize at 11, so now everyone looks the same.</p>\n\n<p>There are several things one can do to accidentally harm their privacy in other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Choosing a reputable mixer, getting non-KYC/AML\'d coins, not reusing addresses, and proper coin output management are all things an individual needs to consider when trying to minimize leakage of metadata. Monero sidesteps many of these problems by making the privacy features mandatory, and setting good defaults for the average user. The example above of using a fixed ringsize means that end users don\'t have to puzzle over how to achieve the best possible privacy in this regard. The wallet does it for them automatically.</p>\n\n<p>This may seem like an odd thing to talk about. Most users could be forgiven for thinking that all software automatically works for them, and not against them. Sadly, nothing could be further from the truth, and when it comes to privacy almost all cryptocurrencies are severely lacking. The amount of effort one has to go through to achieve any level of privacy is usually too much and too difficult for an average user. This is often the case even with other cryptocurrencies that focus on privacy! Monero makes sure to make it so privacy happens automatically, with no thought from users, at the protocol level when possible, and with sane default settings for the wallets when it\'s not. When in doubt, just use the defaults of the wallet, and don\'t be afraid to ask questions.</p>'**

  /// **'<p>Monero’s privacy does not depend on one singular mechanism that, if broken, would reveal the entirety of transactions, but rather three different technologies that work in tandem to provide holistic privacy while compensating for the weaknesses of the other parts. This three-prong approach consists of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/ring-signatures\" class=\"next-link\">ring signatures</a>, RingCT, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/monero-stealth-addresses\" class=\"next-link\">stealth addresses</a>. These three technologies hide the real output (sender), amount, and receiver respectively. Today we’ll be talking about RingCT.</p>\n\n<p>RingCT is arguably the most technical of the three, and can be difficult to understand, so we won’t be covering how it works exactly, but rather showing how it is possible to not know an amount and still confirm things about it. And don’t worry, we’ll use plenty of examples as always.</p>\n\n<p>First, let’s explore why it’s important to verify anything about the amounts. Why can’t we just keep them completely secret? The answer is, there are clever ways that people can create money from thin air if given the opportunity. How might something like this work? Let’s look at an example.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to purchase an item from your friend, and he wants ten dollars for it, then you start with ten dollars and he starts with zero. After you give him the ten dollars, he has ten dollars and you have zero. You started with ten, and now he has ten. No money was created or destroyed in this transaction.</p>\n\n<p>With cryptocurrencies, a clever individual can give ten dollars for the item and instead of receiving zero dollars in change, they can receive two dollars back. Instead of 0 and 10 leading to 10 and 0 (or 10=10), it’s now 0 and 10 leads to 10 and 2 (or 10=12). Two Monero was just created out of thin air. You can imagine that if the individual was to do this to themselves several times, they would be able to amass a gigantic fortune in short order.</p>\n\n<p>With Bitcoin and others, this would be easy to see. You look at the inputs going into a transactions and the outputs coming out and make sure that what is sent equals what is received. If these amounts were encrypted and not visible then a user has no way of verifying that what is sent and what is received is the same.</p>\n\n<p>In an attempt to increase Bitcoin privacy, Gregory Maxwell created Confidential Transactions (CT), a new technology that would allow for encrypted amounts, while proving that nothing was created or destroyed in the process. As with most privacy technology, it did not make it into Bitcoin, but Monero was keen on adopting it. There was just one problem. The already implemented technology of ring signatures was incompatible with the proposed idea. So, one of the MRL researchers at the time, Shen Noether, modified CT into RingCT, a version of CT that was compatible with ring signatures.</p>\n\n<p>Once again, the way this works is quite technical, and would be difficult to explain in an introductory article. For the cryptography enthusiast who simply must know, there are plenty of in-depth articles written on the internet about the inner workings of CT. For the rest of us, this article will show how it might be possible to hide the amounts, but still prove that nothing was created or destroyed.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s say Alice wanted to send Bob money. Alice will send 10 XMR to Bob, who will receive 10 XMR. 10=10 so nothing is wrong here. But Alice doesn’t want anyone to know how much she is sending. So she and Bob create a shared secret. Basically a number that only the two of them know. Let’s say that number is 22. Now, Alice multiplies 10 (what she is really sending) by 22 to get 220. This is the number she shares with the network.</p>\n\n<p>The miners themselves don\'t know the secret number. If they did, they could divide the number they are shown by the secret number and get the real amount sent. But since they don’t, they can’t. They do see that Bob will receive 220 though. 220 sent. 220 received. 220 = 220. In this way, the network can verify that no Monero was created or destroyed, all without knowing the real amount that Alice sent Bob.</p>\n\n<p>Since Bob knows the shared secret number, when he receives the money, he just divides by 22 to get the real amount that Alice sent, 10. Alice and Bob both know how much was sent and how much was received, all while everyone else is given a false number.</p>\n\n<p>Once again, this is not the actual way in which CT works, but it gives an idea of how something like this might be possible. The real way involves things like Pedersen commitments, two sent amounts (one encrypted amount to the receiver and one commitment amount to the network), and…yeah, it’s already easy to see how one could get lost in all that.</p>\n\n<p>One thing to note however, is that while RingCT does hide the amount transacted between two parties in a transaction, it does not hide two other sets of numbers.</p>\n\n<p>The first is the coinbase transactions. If this term is unfamiliar to you, it basically means the reward that miners get for finding the next block. This number is not hidden. Anyone can see how much the protocol has awarded a miner for their service. In this way, the current amount of Monero in existence can be known by adding up all of the coinbase transactions. Their sum will equal the current Monero in circulation.</p>\n\n<p>The second number not hidden is the fee paid to the miners when a user sends a transaction. The fees have to be in the clear so miners can know who to prioritize. This is a way that users can hurt their privacy however, as if someone uses a unique miner fee each time they send a transaction (like 0.12345), then their transactions can be linked.</p>\n\n<p>Other than these cases, RingCT has been hiding Monero amounts since 2017, and our collective privacy is all the stronger for it.</p>'**

  /// **'<p>Monero is known far and wide across the crypto space as being the king of privacy coins. While everyone knows Monero offers good privacy, not as many understand just how the privacy operates.</p>\n\n<p>Many other privacy coins publish comparison chart infographics, which list off the names of each coin’s privacy technology, and in most they label Monero’s tech as RingCT, but this is only partially true. Monero actually has a three-prong approach to privacy. One technology to hide the receiver of a transaction, one to hide the amount sent, and one to hide the output used, these are stealth addresses, RingCT, and ring signatures respectively.</p>\n\n<p>This three-pronged approach means that if one of the technologies is broken, the others do not necessarily share the same fate. Ring signatures are the weakest link in the privacy scheme; the word weak here meaning the most susceptible to heuristic attacks. Let’s take some time to explore them, shall we?</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned above, the goal of ring signatures is to obscure an output used in a transaction. If the \'input/output\' terminology of cryptocurrency is confusing to you, don’t worry. It’s actually not that complicated. When you hear \'output\' just think a check. One of those things, not quite so common anymore, that people use to pay with. Like a check, it can be denoted in any amount - \$10, \$32.50, etc - and is exchanged between transacting parties. For cryptocurrencies, outputs serve these functions.</p>\n\n<p>When someone pays you 10 Monero, you receive a 10 XMR output. This output has a value (10), and is what is taken from the sender’s wallet, in the same way when you pay for a service, a bill leaves your physical wallet and is given to the person you are purchasing from.</p>\n\n<p>The way the output is hidden is by constructing a ring (hence the name) of decoy outputs. But these decoys are not \'fake\' outputs’. They are real past outputs from the blockchain that have nothing to do with the present transaction, but to an outside observer, each of these outputs might look equally probable as the real one. The size of the set of decoy outputs, plus the real one is called the ringsize, and currently Monero’s is eleven. So there are ten decoy outputs and one real one.</p>\n\n<p>Why don’t we just increase this number to 100 or even 1000? The more the better, right? Well, from a privacy perspective, yes, but there are other things to consider. Let’s go back to a physical example to see what I mean. If you wanted to hide one of your dollar bills among ten decoys, you would need to carry around eleven dollars in your wallet for each dollar you wanted to spend. One real dollar, and ten fake ones. This already gets pretty cumbersome if you want to spend even a few dollars. Now imagine we increased the decoy amount to 1000. For every one dollar you wanted to spend, you would need to carry around 1001 dollars. You’d need to carry around a briefcase just to buy one candy bar! It\'s important to note that ring signatures don\'t work quite this way, for example, the decoys themselves are not a part of the signature, only references to them, but we hope this analogy can be somewhat helpful in picturing the basic concepts.</p>\n\n<p>The decoys on the blockchain work similarly. Each added decoy increases the time and verification cost of the transaction. Every node has to download the entire ring signature for each transaction, and each ring signature contains the real output, as well as the decoys. Not only that, but it has to verify the math that at least one of these outputs is real, and the math verification time also increases with each decoy. This means we have to find a happy middle ground, where the ringsize is large enough to adequately obscure the real output, even against many heuristic attacks, but small enough so as not to cause the blockchain to increase at a massive rate. It’s not enough to pick an arbitrary number, or to just increase the ringsize when we make the signature smaller (such as with CLSAG). The Monero community wants concrete, mathematical evidence on which ringsize offer the best trade offs. A number too small, and the privacy will not be strong enough against heuristic attacks. Too large, and we may be getting only marginal benefit on the privacy side, and needlessly suffering in regards to scaling.</p>\n\n<p>One last thing to mention. Some Monero literature simplifies and says that ring signatures hide the sender, but this is not entirely true, and the difference is not just pedantic. The difference between the sender (a human) and an output (a bill) is a big one when it comes to preserving privacy. While an output may have ties to a sender, an output itself does not equal a sender. So even if a ring signature was to be broken, it does not necessarily link to a person’s identity, and both the amount and the receiver are still hidden, minimizing the damage done to the privacy of all parties.</p>\n\n<p>That’s not to say that a broken ring signature is insignificant. Any leaked metadata is bad, and does have the potential to reveal more information than we think, especially when used in conjunction with other metadata. So we do our best to ensure that the ringsize chosen has academic rigor behind the decision, other metadata leakage is minimized, and the user experiences defaults to the best possible actions.</p>\n\n<p>But if the probability of a broken signature is still worrying to you, well, there is some incredible news on the horizon. The next generation of privacy protocols that are being worked on, such as Triptych, Arcturus, and Lelantus, have really neat capabilities. In these protocols, the size scales logarithmically, not linearly, as ringsize increases. This means that we can fit 100 decoys, but the space used is closer to ringsize 10 in the old tech. That’s quite the difference, and will significantly improve privacy all around.</p>\n\n<p>In the cat and mouse game that is privacy, Monero continuously innovates to stay ahead of the curve and ensure the best practical privacy for all.<p>'**

  /// **'<p>It’s a common talking point (and one we fully believe) that Monero makes a better medium of exchange than transparency coins, including Bitcoin. This is because Monero\'s inherent privacy makes it impossible to track, sidestepping many dangers that arise from having your money flow available to all interested parties. As well, the privacy unlocks fungibility, so users can feel confident that every Monero exchanged for a good or service is equivalent to any other since there is no associated past.</p>\n\n<p>As common as this talking point is however, there is another that usually pops up alongside it; that while Monero may be the better medium of exchange, Bitcoin is the better store of value. It’s not uncommon to hear this, even within the Monero community. Use Monero like a spending account, and use Bitcoin like a savings account. When pressed for reasoning, these users don’t even think it’s necessarily because Bitcoin’s price rises at a higher rate than Monero’s, but because Bitcoin has ‘properties’ that make it like digital gold.</p>\n\n<p>We wholeheartedly disagree with this idea and would like to expand on why in this article. Bitcoin’s radical transparency does more to detract from its properties as a store of value than people realize. The first, and most obvious example of this is imagining another commonly accepted store of value, gold, with the transparency that Bitcoin has.</p>\n\n<p>What would happen to the trust in gold if it was possible (trivially many times) to link an amount of gold to an individual or group? Would it still be used as it is if every time gold is transferred it is known that a transfer occurred, who the sender and receiver were, and what amount of gold was transferred? We think not.</p>\n\n<p>One of gold’s properties, that is inherent to it being a real world object, is that it is naturally private. One can artificially give it a history by branding previous owners into a bar of gold, but these can be easily removed by melting the bar down and remaking it, an option that is not present in Bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>This transparency in motion, while destructive enough on its own, is not the only flaw gold would have if all info about its movement was available to everyone. By nature of knowing the flow of gold, we could identify which real world entities have large stores of it. Some of these might not be institutions, but individuals without large scale security set ups. It’s not unheard of for the common person to purchase gold as a hedge against catastrophe, and we now know that Joe Schmoe down the street has 10k dollars worth sitting somewhere in his house. Not information that Joe probably wants the world to know.</p>\n\n<p>A good store of value doesn’t just mean that the price is stable or will possibly go up, it means that the holder feels comfortable and confident in the security of where they have chosen to put their money. So, with radical transparency, gold becomes uncomfortable in motion, and potentially dangerous at rest. It’s good to know then that this was just a thought experiment and gold does not have these properties. Gold investors can breathe a sigh of relief.</p>\n\n<p>But the same can’t be said for Bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>Monero’s privacy does indeed provide much better security both in motion and at rest for anyone that wants to use it as either a checking account or a savings account.</p>\n\n<p>Proponents of Bitcoin will argue, however, that Bitcoin is more secure as a store of value because it has a larger hashrate behind it, so the chain is much less likely to be rewritten (i.e. your coins in storage may be taken), and while this is currently true, it is a social problem that can be changed with time rather than a foundational technological one that is unlikely to ever be rectified.</p>\n\n<p>A second argument for Bitcoin is that it has a fixed supply, whereas Monero has a tail emission. This is extrapolated to mean Monero has an infinite supply, so it is as unfit to be a store of value as fiat. On the surface, this is definitely the more persuasive argument of the two, so we would like to address this one in detail.</p>\n\n<p>While Monero does have a tail emission, this is to ensure Monero’s long term security. Once the last Bitcoin has been minted, there will be no more block reward, leaving the fee market alone to incentivize miners to secure the chain. There is already preliminary research that suggests this will not be enough, and the security of the chain will drop dramatically, leaving the chain vulnerable to 51% attacks.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, this means you have accumulated a store of value that you can never move for fear of an attack. Going back to gold, would gold be at all useful as a store of value if it was impossible or prohibitively dangerous to move around, sell, or exchange? What good is inaccessible value? What good is an accumulated millions of dollars in stored value if it can only ever sit in what might as well be a bottomless pit forever?</p>\n\n<p>Let’s address the other part of this criticism rather than hand-waving away the Monero portion of the problem. The tail emission. While it’s true it has a purpose, some might see the mere existence of the tail emission as evidence that Monero cannot be scarce and works just like fiat. This is also not true. Fiat has a percentage based inflation model, and even this is not set in stone, but rather subject to an opaque body of corruptible humans. This contrasts with Monero, which inflates linearly, meaning over time the inflation trends toward zero. As well it means that, unlike fiat, inflation can be easily calculated and planned for with certainty.</p>'**

  /// **'<p>Monero has implemented a three-prong approach to privacy. These technologies are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/ring-signatures\" class=\"next-link\">ring signatures</a>, which hide the true output (sender), RingCT which hides the amounts, and stealth addresses, which hides the receiver. Today, we will be discussing the last of these mentioned technologies: stealth addresses.</p>\n\n<p>There are many reasons why an individual might want to hide who they are sending to. We must never let anyone try to convince us that all examples of this are unsavory behaviors. Things like sending to a unpopular political party, donating to charities, or supporting those that the culture deems \'cancelled\' are all examples of where one might want to hide their spending behaviors for fear of repercussion, but are perfectly legitimate in nature.</p>\n\n<p>On a transparent blockchain, the addresses where one sends their transactions to are visible to all. It\'s important to consider that if miners themselves disagree with where the money is going, they can choose not to mine it into a block, effectively censoring this transaction on a seemingly censorship resistant platform. The only way to make this, admittedly unlikely, censorship not possible is if miners can\'t distinguish between transactions because all on-chain metadata is obscured by various means. Something that Monero is known for.</p>\n\n<p>Monero solves this problem of transparent addresses by implementing stealth addresses, a technology that was actually initially made for Bitcoin in 2011 by Bitcoin Talk forum user ByteCoin (the relation to Bytecoin, which would later integrate stealth addresses, is unknown). The current form of stealth addresses has several improvements over the initial idea however. But first, in order to see how they work, let\'s talk about keys.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s hard to be in the cryptocurrency space and not hear about keys. Phrases like \'back up your private key\' are common, but when an average Joe hears the words \"public key\" and \"private key\" they get scared and think it will be too technical and confusing to understand. But don\'t worry. We\'ll take it slow, and use plenty of examples.</p>\n\n<p>The two kinds of keys used in cryptocurrencies are, as just mentioned, public and private. These two keys usually come in a pair, meaning that a particular public and private key are linked to one another. In fact, usually the public key is derived from the private one, meaning if you know the private key, your wallet can do some nifty math and come up with the correct public key every time.</p> \n\n<p>Now, as the names imply, the public key can be public without consequence. Usually it\'s a part of the address that you share to receive money into your cryptocurrency wallet. Also following its namesake, the private key is one that should not be shared. It\'s the thing that allows you to sign and spend a transaction, so if it is stolen or shared, then the dastardly third party can spend your money, usually to themselves.</p>\n\n<p>An easy analogy to this would be a padlock and the key needed to unlock it. The open padlock can be shared freely, and indeed anything can be locked up with this padlock, but only the person with the key is able to open anything the padlock is closed on. The padlock can be copied and shared, the key should not be.</p>\n\n<p>These keys are usually abstracted away from the user, so you never really see them. In Monero, they don\'t appear as a scary alphanumeric string at all. In Monero, the common user knows the private key as their seed. The seed (that you should write down if you haven\'t), is actually just a human readable private key. </p>\n\n<p>See? Not so scary after all. Back to stealth addresses.</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned before, stealth addresses weren\'t originally made for Monero, but Bitcoin. As with most fledgling ideas though, this first iteration had issues. The next attempt came when CryptoNote was created by Nicholas van Saberhagan for Bytecoin, the precursor to Monero (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/monero-history\" class=\"next-link\">see our history of Monero and Bytecoin here</a>), and while it was a definite improvement over the original, even it had some subtle flaws.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, one last iteration came into being from a developer for another now-defunct, privacy cryptocurrency, which fixed the outstanding privacy and security issues with the idea. This eventually made its way into Monero, and is what is used today.</p> \n\n<p>Although these privacy and security issues were solved, stealth addresses themselves added a different kind of quirk to blockchain technologies, one that didn’t exist before. The need to scan. Since receiving addresses are not publicly displayed on the blockchain, the receiver never knows if any given transaction is theirs, so they must scan every incoming transactions with their private key to see if it’s theirs.</p>\n\n<p>With transparency coins, all they have to do is check to see if a transaction is sending to your address. An easy yes or no question. But with stealth addresses, every transaction could potentially be one that is being sent to you, so you have to try to unlock each one with your private key to see if it opens.</p> \n\n<p>This is an extra step that Bitcoin and its derivatives do not have, and makes initial wallet setup, along with syncing a wallet when you haven’t opened it for a while, much longer than Bitcoin. The tradeoff is necessary though, to unlock the privacy guarantees it has. It should be noted that, unlike the weakest point of the privacy trifecta, ring signatures, stealth addresses is not susceptible to heuristics. It relies on tried and true elliptic curve cryptography, which the entire internet relies on, so breaking it would mean an end to computer security in general, not just Monero.</p> '**

  /// **'<p>Monero has always found innovative ways to solve difficult privacy problems. Often times these innovations lead to other innovations, and sometimes these resulting technologies can even be used for usecases not previously considered. Nowhere is this exemplified more than in the case of Monero\'s subaddress technology.</p>\n\n<p>Consider a hypothetical privacy problem, wherein usage of one address across multiple platforms from seemingly unrelated peoples can lead to the linkage and deanonymization of said peoples. Put simply, if you were a person named Billy Joe Bob and you sold apples for Bitcoin, you might post your Bitcoin address in a public place for customers to pay you. Let\'s say the address starts with the alphanumeric string 7XybV3... But tossing aside the obvious privacy risk of anyone being able to check your Bitcoin balance and see how much you have sold, there\'s a second, not often talked about privacy risk. Let\'s say you were also an underground hacker going by the name of l33tz0r. You do whistle blowing work, telling an unsuspecting populace about government corruption, and it\'s imperative that you keep your identity a secret. You accept Bitcoin donations for your work, and post the address on a public forum. It\'s the same address that you accept money from your apple customers. The 7XybV3... one.</p>\n\n<p>A simple, but devastating deanonymization attack would be to use an internet search engine to search for your Bitcoin address. Putting the address of 7XybV3... in the engine brings up two different results. The apple business, and l33tz0r. This is enough to link the two identities and deanonymize l33tz0r, with potentially scary consequences from the powers that be.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s important to note that this attack is ALSO possible with Monero. Even though Monero hides most on-chain data, this attack doesn\'t use any. It only uses the address, which must be shared in order to receive payment. Publicly in the case of anonymous donations. This is one potential way in which Monero users can unwittingly hurt their privacy, and is also an example of how, even though Monero is top tier in regards to privacy retention, it is not bulletproof.</p>\n\n<p>The usual way of getting around this problem was owning multiple wallets. With different addresses posted for every identity (or usecase), they cannot be linked. But this privacy only holds if the user never mixes them up. Accidentally posting the incorrect address would have the same linkage effects. As well, the seed of each address must be kept secure, increasing the infosec work necessary with each new wallet made.</p>\n\n<p>Monero\'s solution was subaddresses. The ability to create an absolutely massive number of addresses underneath the main address, using it as a seed of sorts. Every generated subaddress can accept Monero, and all of it goes to the same wallet. Using this method, the number of identities that can be operated under one address is huge while keeping the infosec work to a minimum. These addresses are also not mathematically linkable, so unless the user shouts their connection to the world, an outside observer will have great difficulty linking them.</p>\n\n<p>But another interesting usecase emerged from subaddresses; as a replacement option of the universally hated payment IDs.</p>\n\n<p>Payment IDs were a way for merchants to identify which customer sent which payment. Since Monero information is obscured on chain, the receiver of a transaction is not able to see which address sent it. This means that if there are similarly priced items and multiple orders, it can become impossible to identify who sent what. Payment IDs are a unique, random string generated by the merchant and given to the customer. The customer adds this as a separate field when sending the transaction. This random string is placed on the blockchain as part of the transaction, and in this way, the merchant is able to identify and sort through incoming transactions.</p>\n\n<p>This method was flawed in several ways. Firstly, it detracts from the uniformity of on-chain data. Additional, unique metadata can make some transactions stand apart from the crowd, thereby allowing heuristic analysis. This is especially true when this metadata is not enforced as mandatory for all. Making this mandatory for everyone would add needless space to the blockchain though, and was not pursued. As well, if a payment ID was ever reused for any reason, it would be trivial to link two transactions as connected. This typically occurred with exchange deposits, and anyone could easily link transactions as both being a deposit on an exchange, and from one particular individual.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, from a UX perspective, payment IDs create a second step that cryptocurrency users coming from other coins are not used to, and if they are forgotten then it causes a massive headache to the merchant who must identify these transactions via other means. This was typically done by speaking directly with each customer who forgot to put the payment ID and confirming other identifying information that only they could know, such as a combination of the amount, date sent, and transaction ID.</p>\n\n<p>This extra step was missed by many, and it got to the point where some exchanges started to charge money to customers if their money had to be manually retrieved because of forgetting a payment ID. Others grit their teeth and ate the extra support costs, but nobody was happy about it.</p>\n\n<p>There was one solution to this, integrated addresses, which merged the address and the payment ID into one string, so it couldn’t be forgotten, but adoption was fairly weak, despite the benefits merchants would have received from including it.</p>\n\n<p>In an interesting turn of events, subaddresses came in to save the day. The ability to generate large amounts of subaddresses per main address, and identify which transactions came into which subaddresses, allowed merchants to rid themselves of payment IDs in an elegant way, while adopting the next generation of Monero technology. Since then, most exchanges and merchant tools have switched to subaddresses as the primary way of transaction identification.</p>\n\n<p>What started as a solution for a privacy problem turned into something much more, which solved a major UX issue for merchants and customers alike. Innovation begets more innovation, which can often snowball into unexpected wins for everyone. Monero has seen this time and time again, and puts great effort into innovating what is possible on the blockchain. Who knows what other things we can unlock together?</p>'**

  /// **'<p>Few ideas in the cryptocurrency space receive as much attention and discussion as the concept of trust, and not without reason. After all, the entire point of a blockchain is to eliminate trust in third parties.</p>\n\n<p>For those who don’t fully understand the idea, here’s a light primer. In the traditional financial system, third parties are generally used for various tasks. Banks are used to secure money on your behalf from theft, arbiters. Escrows are used so business deals can operate between two parties that don’t trust each other. Credit card companies pay out money for goods and services on your behalf, assuming the risk that you might not pay them back.</p>\n\n<p>Each of these instances requires trust. For the banks and escrow agents, you are trusting that they themselves will not run off with your money, and for credit card companies, you trust they will not pay out money in your name without your consent, all of which are very possible. We do what we can to ensure these things do not occur. We only work with trusted companies and individuals, and we legislate to make the above scenarios illegal and try to ensure consequences to offenders, but that doesn’t always stop them from happening anyways.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, these services do not come for free. Escrow agents and banks may charge for their services, and credit cards charge interest on loaned money.</p>\n\n<p>Blockchain was made to eliminate these middle men, and the trust and fees that come along with them. Through the power of consensus, users can themselves enforce the state of the ledger, without trusting anyone to tell them how much money they have, and without any trusted third parties to potentially run off with your funds.</p>\n\n<p>So much emphasis is placed on this trustlessness, that any change or technological addition that adds an element of trust back into the blockchain is met with great skepticism and criticism, and some projects reject all such notions outright. It’s interesting then that the same consideration is not given to privacy.</p>\n\n<p>Once again, we look at the rest of the world and we see that too often, our privacy is at the mercy of ‘trusted’ third parties. When we give our physical addresses for an item we want shipped to us, we are trusting that the store in question will not use this info for nefarious purposes, or sell it to others. The same is true of our personal thoughts or photos that we post on social media. It even applies to our finances, as several hacks within the accounting industry, or finance apps that flat out post to an internal public board what people are spending money on (i.e Venmo).</p>\n\n<p>Monero sees this commitment to trustlessness on the blockchain, and applies a similar standard to how we approach privacy. Our privacy should not depend on a third party promising to keep it safe any more than our finances should depend on others promising us they won’t run off with them. To this end, Monero ensures that all privacy technologies implemented are trustless.</p>\n\n<p>There are other privacy technologies floating around. Trusted ones, and, admittedly, they are not without their strong points. Zcash uses certain types of proving systems as building blocks in its confidential transaction protocol which have very strong privacy guarantees, with large anonymity sets and, used correctly, could be a powerful way to ensure your privacy. The drawback to this approach however, as part of the initial setup of this technology, there needs to be a parameter set that must be chosen and subsequently forgotten. If anyone retains this parameter, they would have the ability to create false SNARK proofs, effectively printing money without anyone being the wiser because it’s hidden. But does this affect privacy? Some theorize yes, while others no, and in the end, more research needs to be done to come to a definitive answer.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, this process of minimizing trust sounds just like the scenarios we discussed in the beginning of this article. The traditional world. The one we’re trying to move away from. Blockchain itself doesn’t reduce trust in third parties, but rather eliminates it. The Monero community thinks the same standard of elimination rather than reduction should be applied to our privacy technologies also. Just because it is not definitively proven that trusted setups can or cannot compromise privacy doesn’t mean we should be lax about allowing trust back into the system in this regard.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, any progression in the privacy space is an improvement, and often trusted privacy is merely a stepping stone to trustless privacy, and in these cases we are happy to see the space moving forward. And yet, at the same time, the Monero community just cannot, in good conscience, deploy privacy technology on our blockchain that would weaken the very purpose of our revolution.</p>\n\n<p>We often get asked the question of when Monero is going to implement this or that new privacy tech. These questions often come from the uninformed, who don’t understand the trade-offs, and are merely parroting the new privacy buzzwords of the day. The answer to these questions is simple. Monero is constantly looking at, reviewing, and researching new privacy protocols that would strengthen the privacy guarantees on the Monero chain, but we are unwilling to delve into the world of trusted privacy to achieve this goal, even if the guarantees are theoretically stronger.</p>\n\n<p>Some say this approach will prove to be outdated, but we think such people have lost the story of why we are here to begin with.</p>'**

When any of these rules need to be changed or upgraded, the network has to agree on the new rules, causing a “hard-fork” – a situation where the network actually splits into two chains of blocks – one on the old rules, and one on the new rules.</p>\n<p>When everyone in the community agrees on the rule changes, it’s called a “non-contentious hard-fork”, and the chain that still has the old rules dies off and is not mined on after the hard-fork. This has been the case for almost every Monero hard-fork, and the only continuation of old rules was by projects attempting to profit off of the hard-fork.</p>\n<p>While non-contentious hard-forks are the only way to properly upgrade important aspects of the Monero network, they do also have a frustrating side-effect – old software, released before the hard-fork was planned, cannot understand the new rules of the network and so does not function after the hard-fork! This can lead to users thinking funds are lost, thinking the Monero blockchain has stopped, and being unable to move funds until they upgrade their wallet.</p>'**

  /// **'<p>In both the privacy and cryptocurrency spheres, misinformation often runs rampant. We have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/knowledge/monero-myths-debunked\" class=\"next-link\">an article outlining fifteen common incorrect or outdated assumptions about Monero</a>, but we want to take time to address one particular article that is often cited and circulated by Monero skeptics.</p>\n\n<p>The Wired publication put out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/monero-privacy/\" class=\"next-link\">an article</a> on the 27th of March, 2018, which itself was written in response to another fresh-off-the-press paper published by various academics titled: “An Empirical Analysis of Traceability in the Monero Blockchain”.</p>\n\n<p>Though the paper was coauthored by individuals with clear conflict of interest (read: they are advisors to, and have a stake in Zcash), the paper was moderately well-received by the Monero community as confirming things the community has already known and written about in their own Monero Research Lab papers (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://web.getmonero.org/resources/research-lab/pubs/MRL-0001.pdf\" class=\"next-link\">MRL-0001</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://web.getmonero.org/resources/research-lab/pubs/MRL-0004.pdf\" class=\"next-link\">MRL-0004</a>) the earliest of which was published four years prior. There were also several frustrations with it however, chiefly the conflict of interest, the fact that the issues were already known, discussed and – in some cases – remedied, and the gross mischaracterization of Monero’s privacy guarantees at the time. The community commented on the preprint of the work, and many of their recommendations made it through to the final paper.</p>\n\n<p>But what exactly was mischaracterized? The fact that Monero had not had the flaws discussed in the paper for over a year. Transactions pre-2017 were indeed vulnerable to a form of privacy leakage, but at the time of publishing, Monero had addressed most of the concerns. To be fair to the authors, they discuss Monero’s remedies to a small degree, but not enough to influence the effect it had on the cryptocurrency media cycle at the time. Hence the Wired article.</p>\n\n<p>While we can examine the Wired article in question as a period piece, and how true or untrue it was at the time, the fact that it is still being shared today as reasoning for why Monero’s privacy guarantees are weak actually invite an analysis on how the piece holds up in the present. We gladly take this invitation.</p>\n\n<p>A quick read of the article shows several sensationalized lines, such as “[The findings] shouldn’t just worry anyone trying to stealthily spend Monero today” and the entire tone of the article which postulates the research as ‘new’, based largely off of the publication. The academic paper itself has recommendations such as warning Monero users of the potential compromise of their anonymity, despite the fact that not only had these discussions been happening since 2014, but the rallying cry of the community was for people to not buy Monero and that it was very experimental.</p>\n\n<p>But what of the criticisms themselves? The reality is that many issues with Monero as a privacy coin are either no longer true of Monero, or shared concerns with privacy coins as a category of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. Let’s begin addressing these.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most often-quoted criticisms of Monero is that, because of the permanence and immutability of the blockchain, if a future technology was to break the privacy, all of Monero’s past transactions would be laid bare. In other words, your privacy has a ticking clock on it.</p>\n\n<p>We cannot stress this enough. Literally every privacy coin that employs on-chain methods for obfuscation and privacy has this flaw, and yet it is often used against Monero (ironically, many times by competing privacy coins with the same problem), and is used in this article as well. The response to this criticism might be surprising to some, but Monero actually may be less vulnerable than other privacy coins to this due to the fact that it has a multi-pronged approach to privacy.</p>\n\n<p>Monero hides outputs (senders), amounts, and receivers through three different technologies, ring signatures, RingCT, and stealth addresses respectively. Of these, ring signatures are the weakest, and most susceptible to both modern day heuristics and theoretical, future, privacy-breaking technologies. This has been known to the Monero community for years, and active research is underway to improve or replace the ring signature scheme entirely.</p>\n\n<p>However, even if the ring signature was broken entirely, only the true output would be revealed. NOT the sender (as in individual), but the output. To couple an output with an identity is not impossible, but it would require more metadata and resources. Coupled with the fact that RingCT and the stealth address would NOT be revealed lessens the impact even further.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that the Wired article does lightly discuss the above information in the portion where they reached out to Riccardo ‘fluffypony’ Spagni for comment, but the time given to it is brief, and almost seems to hand-wave away this crucial information. The lack of understanding is especially apparent when trying to discuss these things with people who share the article willy-nilly in the modern day.</p>\n\n<p>Another criticism that’s much harder to address is in how the outside world views Monero, and how that relates with how the community around Monero views the coin. For an example of this, readers need not look farther than the title of the article itself: “The Dark Web’s Favorite Currency Is Less Untraceable Than It Seems”.</p>\n\n<p>Any person who spends any significant amount of time in the Monero community can attest to the fact that the Monero community goes to great lengths to show just how hard real privacy is to achieve, even to the detriment of marketing or adoption efforts. If the community provides ample resources discussing the coin and its shortcomings accurately, at some point, the ignorance becomes the fault of the user who believes that the coin is all they need to be 100% private.</p>\n\n<p>By this point it should be evident that the Monero community takes seriously both its privacy, and its honesty about the weaknesses therein and subsequent improvements. Articles, like the one in question, completely miss this spirit of innovation in Monero. It likens Monero to the droves of other cryptocurrencies that make grandiose claims, with only thought for profit and to prey on uneducated investor-wannabes.</p>\n\n<p>The reality couldn’t be more different. Monero is acutely aware of its weaknesses, seeks to continue building so as to improve them, tighten up loose joints, and achieve the very real, but very hard goal of giving the world a private, fungible cryptocurrency that can be used by all, and do it all in a manner that is fair, decentralized, and community-driven. Perhaps it’s time to put away the sensationalization and article sharing as a means to shill bags and promote competitors. Perhaps it’s time to tell another story.</p>'**
